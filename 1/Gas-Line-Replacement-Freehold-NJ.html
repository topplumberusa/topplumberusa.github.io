<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
