Inspect to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated up and offered for usage.

<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
