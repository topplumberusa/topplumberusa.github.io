<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of small, possibly less critical things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
<p>While fighting a fire, firefighters are not surprisingly more worried about drawing enough water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they utilize water from any readily available source to accomplish their goal, however fire department vehicles frequently bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, rust inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or permanent connection between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water system or customer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
