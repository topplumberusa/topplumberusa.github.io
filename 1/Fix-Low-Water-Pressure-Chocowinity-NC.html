<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system.

Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
