Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable supply of water within a building these devices are known as isolation" BFP.

The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
