Call 903-630-6153 and speak to one of our specialist piping professionals about entire house repiping today if your pipes are old and deteriorating. For the average house that does not have serious water problems, the Aquakinetic Series is created with 2 tanks to provide you with soft, clean water. These systems are non-electric and are essentially maintenance-free.</p>

The tank eventually loses its ability to seal effectively, developing waste and a greater water costs.</p>
