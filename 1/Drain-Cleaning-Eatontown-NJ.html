<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you don't get that chance. In addition, your contractor knows the indicators of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in joists, floorings, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not danger working with a shoddy plumber. An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and complicate the task with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and suits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the best.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature is kept at or above 40 Â° F.

The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard security assembly.</p>
