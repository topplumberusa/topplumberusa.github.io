<p>Water supplied by the public utility contains some amounts of hazardous chemicals like arsenic and lead.

A house plumbing inspection will either be visual, made with a camera, or a mix of both.</p>
<p>Gently raise the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water shuts down, you may have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's changed properly (Picture 8). You do not have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>When a plumbing license has actually been released in error since of inaccurate, unreliable or incomplete information, or the work for which the authorization was released breaches the Uniform Code, such permit will be withdrawed or suspended up until such time as the license holder shows that all work completed and all work proposed will remain in compliance with appropriate arrangements of the code.</p>
