For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
