<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
