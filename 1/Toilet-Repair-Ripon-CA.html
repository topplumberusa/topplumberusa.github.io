<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in locations where the ambient temperature level is maintained at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water streams right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In scenarios where there is a need to offer sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small loading dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high risk security assembly.</p>
