<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and pricey plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. It was a difficult job because of the age of your house and location of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
