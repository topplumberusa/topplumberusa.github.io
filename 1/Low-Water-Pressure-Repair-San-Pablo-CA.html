<p>Rusting and corrosion on the outside of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can indicate a potential concern with the hot water heater. It can also mean the water heater is near the end of its life if it is more than 6 or 7 years of ages. With heavy rust buildup on valves for water lines to and from the heater, it might mean that there have been changes in pressure causing little leakages.</p>
