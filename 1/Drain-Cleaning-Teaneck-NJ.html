<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Teaneck NJ 07666</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
