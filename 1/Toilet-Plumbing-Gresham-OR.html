<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a practical service, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many downsides to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your home and family.</p>
