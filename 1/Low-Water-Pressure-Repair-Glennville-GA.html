If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. You must wait up until after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth.

A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>

<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
