<p>106.2.3 Plumbing Maintenance. The clearing of blockages in fixture branches; the fixing of incidental leaks in components, pipes or valves; or the elimination and reinstallation of existing or new plumbing components, residential type plumbing home appliances, non-testable backflow devices, and plumbing appurtenances; provided that such repairs do not need the replacement or include of concealed piping, or the rearrangement of valves, pipes or components.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>The typical toilet will last for decades and have minimal problems that can be easily fixed without replacement. However, when it is time for toilet replacement, it is important to have a experienced and licensed  plumber handle the task. At Morrison Plumbing, Heating and Air, we have more than thirty years of experience with toilet installation and toilet replacement. Whether you need a new toilet for a bathroom remodel, moving into a brand-new home, or merely wishing to update your present toilet, we ensure that our installation process won't damage your house or its plumbing system.</p>
