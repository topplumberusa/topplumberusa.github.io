<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow in a potable water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can only flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always stream towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The need upstream could trigger a reversal in circulation.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
