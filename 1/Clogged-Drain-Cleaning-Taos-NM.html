If there is a consistent sewage odor in your house, it is important that you call a qualified plumber. Raw sewage is very dangerous and can posture severe health threats.</p>
<p>As soon as per year to clean out the drains and keep everything running smoothly, we recommend that house owners invest in cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber at least.

Sometimes whatever is blocking the drain will not budge. It might be time to call a professional plumber if you've tried to unclog a bathroom or kitchen sink with no luck.
