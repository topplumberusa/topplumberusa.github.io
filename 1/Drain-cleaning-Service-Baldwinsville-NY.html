<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible service, specifically when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids.
