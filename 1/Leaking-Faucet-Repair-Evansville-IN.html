<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Evansville IN</h3>
<p>The most effective way to address tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>This is very essential! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to press the waste out of your drain system. Present policies limit the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles piling up in cast iron drain lines.
