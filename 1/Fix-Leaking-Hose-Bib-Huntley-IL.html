<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in areas where the ambient temperature level is kept at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little packing dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high threat protection assembly.</p>
