After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in areas where the ambient temperature level is kept at or above 40 ° F.

The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high threat protection assembly.</p>
