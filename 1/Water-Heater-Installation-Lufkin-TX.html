Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
