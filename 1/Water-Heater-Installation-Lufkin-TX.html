Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
