<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
