Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.
