<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. Since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally restore after numerous gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
