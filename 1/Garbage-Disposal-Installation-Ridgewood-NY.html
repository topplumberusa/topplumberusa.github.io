<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Ridgewood NY 11385?</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
