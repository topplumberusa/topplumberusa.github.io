<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and detailed plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can cause rust that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and removes from the capability of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
