<h3>Leaky Faucet Repair in Medford Massachusetts</h2>
<p>No, you should NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're severe about securing your drain and plumbing system. The factor is that these chemical cleaners can be much more destructive than useful, potentially eating away at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a home's entire plumbing system, including both water supply and drain lines. Typically, a whole-house repipe deserves the financial investment in the long run since it may resolve the root reason for the chronic plumbing problems in your house.</p>
<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing offered excellent service for us in replacing a really balky tub spout, and worn out toilet parts. Not only was he very professional and comprehensive but he had the ability to respond to all my questions concerning the service. I would give 6 stars if I could. A video camera inspection of your sewer line is one of the most reliable methods of locating the exact whereabouts of a plumbing issue. A plumber will insert a specially designed waterproof camera through your sewer line and capture live video footage to determine where and what the source of the issue is.</p>
<p>Some disposals are connected to the dishwasher, which enables self-cleaning. This location often experiences leaks as well.
