It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it as well.</p>
