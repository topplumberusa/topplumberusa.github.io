<p>Any location water goes through home. This includes sinks, toilets, pipes, tubs, and lines. At this time, the pro will search for leaks and broken pipes or fittings.

<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this approach, you know the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
