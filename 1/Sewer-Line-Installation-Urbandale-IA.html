<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are altering the economics of water softening in the carwash industry. Generally, the savings have been based mostly on reducing chemical and cleaning agent expenses. While those cost savings are still significant, brand-new commercial softening technology using multi-tank systems (MTS) likewise provides considerable water and salt cost savings.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
