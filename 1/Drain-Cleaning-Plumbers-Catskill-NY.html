Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
