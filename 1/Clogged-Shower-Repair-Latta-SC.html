Water pressure may be or fail reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
