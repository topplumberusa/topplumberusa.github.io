<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally regenerate after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
