Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet.
