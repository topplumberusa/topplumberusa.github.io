<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to identify.</p>
