<p>A camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your backyard. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images caught by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>Consider all the areas water streams in and out of your house. These are the locations that a professional assessment need to cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other appliances. Even your water lines must be covered. While your water heater and toilets will get special attention, a skilled plumber aims to examine the total health of your system. That implies testing for proper water pressure.
