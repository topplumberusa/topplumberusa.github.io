<p>When you eliminate the cap to eliminate the valve, examine the washer for wear or cracks. Replacing a bad washer is low-cost and easy. But finding the right washer might not be.

These crystals are tiny and flow normally through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need continuous regeneration.</p>
<p>Plumbers generally start out as apprentices. From there, they test and earn a journey plumbing license, and eventually be granted a master plumbing license.
