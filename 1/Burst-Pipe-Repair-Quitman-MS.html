That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>

You, therefore, need to utilize a growing number of cleaning agent to attain the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option.

Lastly, water consisting of the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
