<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair cracked pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Daily usage must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can also occur if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a stable and safe place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you must wait till after the cycle is completed and after that examined the system for fractures or broken fittings. You need to also inspect to make certain your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi).
