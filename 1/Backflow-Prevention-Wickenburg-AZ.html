<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (rather than constant or direct) of the part, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>

This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour.

<p>It generally signifies rust and mineral accumulation if you notice low water pressure or stained water. As rust and minerals build up in time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you might see lower water pressure. The staining takes place when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and circulation into your supply of water, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or rust can end up being a health hazard in your water.</p>
