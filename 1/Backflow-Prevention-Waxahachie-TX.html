<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by removing firmness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the firmness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate solidity from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
