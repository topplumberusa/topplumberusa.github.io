The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no chance to offer one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>
