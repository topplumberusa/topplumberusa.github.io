<p>As soon as the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
