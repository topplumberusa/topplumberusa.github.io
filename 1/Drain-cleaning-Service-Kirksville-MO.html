<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Kirksville MO</h3>
<p>To figure out if your home is a poly home," begin with the outside. Underground water mains are usually blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it goes into the house near the water heater. Your main turned off is attached to the end of the water main. Make certain you examine both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe gets in the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Was your house built before the 1970s and has not undergone remodeling or pipe replacement? It is most likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another material which has rusted and rotted over the years if so.
