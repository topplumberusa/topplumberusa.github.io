<p>When the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or component which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may occur. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not effectively protected.</p>
<p>New shower drains develop strong seals that are less likely to loosen up in time. Several alternatives are terrific for tight spaces and allow for fast installation.
