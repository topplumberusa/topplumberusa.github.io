<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Concord CA</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great reviews and a fair cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it as well.</p>
