Your Roto-Rooter drain service technician will aesthetically check your commercial roof drain system then quote you a fair rate for cleaning it, based upon the diameter and length of the pipes.</p>

As a clog ends up being larger with time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining appropriately.
