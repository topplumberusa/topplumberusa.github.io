<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
