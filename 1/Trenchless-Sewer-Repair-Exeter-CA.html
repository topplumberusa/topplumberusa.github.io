<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks in Exeter CA 93221?</h3>

Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
