<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to obstructions with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. If fats are put down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls.

If this is what is occurring to your house, you need your drain cleaned up before it results in additional damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
