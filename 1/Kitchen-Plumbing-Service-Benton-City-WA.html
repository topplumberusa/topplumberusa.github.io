<p>To determine if your house is a poly home," begin with the exterior. Underground water pipe are generally blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it enters the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is connected to completion of the water pipe. Make certain you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
