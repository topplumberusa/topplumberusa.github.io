<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
