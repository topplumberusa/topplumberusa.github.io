It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly operating RPZ assembly to periodically release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in areas subject to water damage. Adequate drainage must also be offered.</p>
<p>Examine Valves and Double Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers available that you may face. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a double check". It is NOT the very same thing as a Check even though it might be marketed as one! Do not get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses comparable to Check (5 PSI).</p>
