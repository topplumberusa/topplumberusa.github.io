<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
