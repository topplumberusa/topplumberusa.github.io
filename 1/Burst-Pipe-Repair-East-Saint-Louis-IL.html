<h3>Quality Plumbing Service East Saint Louis IL</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had great evaluations and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
<p>This does not include the cost of the actual sink or any extra features such as faucets, waste disposal unit, spray hose, etc Our drain and sewer cleaning services provide long-lasting solutions if you're dealing with a backup or clogged toilet.
