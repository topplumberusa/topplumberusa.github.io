<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
