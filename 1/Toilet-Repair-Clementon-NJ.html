<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Clementon NJ</h3>
<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
