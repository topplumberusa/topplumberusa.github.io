<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes 2 fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
