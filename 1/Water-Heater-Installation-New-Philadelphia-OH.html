<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair professional knows the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
