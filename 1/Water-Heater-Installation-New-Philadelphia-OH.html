It is important that the repair professional knows the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation.
