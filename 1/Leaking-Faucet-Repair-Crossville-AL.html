<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
