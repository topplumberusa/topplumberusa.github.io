This represents polyethylene piping. This plastic product is fairly durable and flexible and can withstand standard temperature variations. PEX is resistant to scaling, chlorine, and rust and the pipes can be pieced together without elbows or joints.</p>
<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to prevent winter freezing. The new pipe, made from a state-of-the-art, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls.

We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for an extensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to enable the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and offer a careful cleaning.</p>
