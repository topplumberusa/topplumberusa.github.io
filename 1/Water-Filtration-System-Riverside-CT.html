<p>A drain professional will need to access the drain line from the roof vents or pull out a toilet. This is typically more labor-intensive and may require extra expenses. Because the drain machine loses torque the even more you are away from the blockage, this is also not as effective. If you want to put new pipes in your house or you're constructing a house, there are 3 kinds of new plumbing pipe available that are building-code approved for houses-- copper, PEX, and CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride). PEX and CPVC are both plastics and are outstanding options to the costly copper piping.</p>
