<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Butler PA</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a fair cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it too.</p>
