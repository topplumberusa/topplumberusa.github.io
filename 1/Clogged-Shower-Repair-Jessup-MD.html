<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
