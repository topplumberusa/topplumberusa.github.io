It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut down stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from crucial areas in the assembly.
