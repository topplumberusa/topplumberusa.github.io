<p>If you have an older home, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode. This rust can result in a buildup of lead, which can have numerous unfavorable effects on your health. Corroded pipes also cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>We specialize in repair, service and installation of all makes and designs of gas water heaters, electric hot water heater and tankless hot water heater. Gently flex the float arm down to put extra pressure on the toilet valve. (To adjust a float that doesn't have an arm, see Picture 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works. Running toilets can be the result of a corroded overflow pipe, worn flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Offer the specialists at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and minimize lost water.</p>
