<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
