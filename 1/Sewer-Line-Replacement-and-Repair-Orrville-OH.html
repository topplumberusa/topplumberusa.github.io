If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
