<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a very crucial part of the style of each part. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the movement (rather than consistent or direct) of the element, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
