<p>Likewise called a garbage disposer, a waste disposal unit comes in two fundamental types - constant feed, which normally has a wall-mounted switch so the system keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover be in place to run the system.

An Ohio plumbing supply company offers an overview of garbage disposal types and designs.</p>
