<p>When you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve, check the washer for wear or fractures. Replacing a bad washer is easy and inexpensive. But finding the best washer might not be. The most typical washers are frequently readily available in the house centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be tough to discover.
