Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
