<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more.

<p>Grey = End-User Pressure - water presses past the # 2 check valve into the system of the end user. The # 2 Check avoids backflow brought on by pressure boosts in the down stream plumbing.
