<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
