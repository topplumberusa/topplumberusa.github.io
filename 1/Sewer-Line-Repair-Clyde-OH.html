It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had great reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
