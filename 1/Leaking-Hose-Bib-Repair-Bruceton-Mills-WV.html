<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
