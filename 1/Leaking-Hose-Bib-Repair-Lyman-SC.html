<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a practical solution, specifically when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your home and family.</p>
