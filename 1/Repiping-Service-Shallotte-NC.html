<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals expect to see but rarely stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
