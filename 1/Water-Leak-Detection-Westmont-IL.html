<p>No, you should NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're major about protecting your drain and plumbing system. The factor is that these chemical cleaners can be far more damaging than handy, potentially eating away at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's whole plumbing system, including both supply of water and drain lines.

<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
