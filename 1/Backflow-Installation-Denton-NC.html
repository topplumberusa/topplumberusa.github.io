<p>Examine the home's warm water heater You will be wanting to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of 4 should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Examine to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible.
