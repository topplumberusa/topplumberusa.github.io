<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property.
