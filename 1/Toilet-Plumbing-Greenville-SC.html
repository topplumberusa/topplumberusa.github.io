<p>The electrical and plumbing work involved in garbage disposal installation make the task possibly hazardous.

<p>The source or location of a sewer issue identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>When a plumbing license has been released in mistake since of incorrect, insufficient or unreliable details, or the work for which the license was released violates the Uniform Code, such permit will be withdrawed or suspended until such time as the permit holder demonstrates that all work completed and all work proposed will remain in compliance with applicable provisions of the code.</p>
