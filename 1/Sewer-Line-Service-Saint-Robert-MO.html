If your house was built prior to the 1970s, we strongly recommend that you employ a plumbing professional to check your home's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping. Possibilities are that your house may need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can function at optimum rates if your home was constructed decades before that.</p>
