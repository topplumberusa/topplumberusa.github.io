<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow of water which might bring unclean water or other, harmful substances into the public water system and private plumbing. Backflow can occur in a number of situations that might draw water from locations such as garden fountains, pool, or lawn sprinkler systems into City water supply lines. If it is connected to any outside water source, Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not uncommon, however if your toilet is blocking more than three times a month, there's a bigger issue to examine. If your toilet is reasonably brand-new, you may need to switch toilet tissue or employ a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can search for your state's licensing information. Inspect the list of state licensing agencies to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also maintains a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a serious public health danger if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of illness or illness.</p>
