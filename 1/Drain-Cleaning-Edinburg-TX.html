<p>ow gadgets prevent used water from reentering the District's potable water system in the event of a malfunction in a customer's pressure equipment or an unexpected drop in pressure in EBMUD's water system.

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully listen and raise the rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. Make sure it's changed appropriately (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
