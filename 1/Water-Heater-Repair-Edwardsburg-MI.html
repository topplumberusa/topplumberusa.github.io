The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Frequently, it enters the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is attached to completion of the water main. Make certain you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have actually found cases where the copper pipe enters the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
