Even trees and bushes can trigger problems for sewer lines, especially in older neighborhoods where clay pipe might have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as compounded if pipes have been enabled to freeze.</p>
<p>Don't put everything down your garbage disposal. It is very important to enjoy what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can likewise trigger jams and blockages - think about composting or positioning these products in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can cake and gather in your drain too. After ending up cooking, consider pouring leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside. You can then reheat and utilize for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
