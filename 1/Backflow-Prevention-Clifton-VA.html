PEX is resistant to corrosion, scaling, and chlorine and the pipes can be pieced together without elbows or joints.</p>

The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new seamless pipe behind it.
