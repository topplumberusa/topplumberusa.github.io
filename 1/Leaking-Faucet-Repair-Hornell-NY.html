<p>Tankless Water Heaters - supply warm water on demand without a tank. The activation of a faucet requiring warm water triggers the heater and water is heated up as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Cooking oil and other greases must never ever be put down the garbage disposal because they can restrain the blades.

Based on the condition of the line, it might be an acceptable alternative to do just that. However, if the balanced out worsens trenchless may no longer be an alternative.</p>
