<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are seriously harmed, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes two four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for approximately 100 years.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully listen and raise the rod. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no change screw. Make sure it's adjusted correctly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>It assists to know the brand name and design of your toilet. The brand is normally on the bowl behind the seat. Sometimes, the model or number will be on the underside of the cover or inside the tank. Matching an uncommon flapper can become an experimental process. Even professional plumbers in some cases try two or three flappers before they discover one that works well.</p>
