<p>Depending on your situation, your plumber might use one or a combination of piping material during your house repiping project. Copper is basic due to the fact that it's long-lasting, can endure fires, and resists weather condition. However, copper is tough to install, which means greater labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of flexibility, which indicates plumbers can bend the pipes removing the need for joints, which saves money and time and minimizes the threat of joint leakages.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
