<p>As soon as the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
