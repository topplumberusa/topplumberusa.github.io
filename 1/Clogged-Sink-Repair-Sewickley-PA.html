<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>

Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
