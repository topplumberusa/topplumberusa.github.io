<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from reversing in the opposite direction. You have permanent water firmness if you don't see limescale build-up but instead see soap residue, your washing cleaning agents not working as efficiently or your skin getting delicate and itchy. If you smell gas, do not attempt to locate the leak. Rather, leave the house or building immediately. Do not switch on or off any electrical switches, appliances, or lights, as an electrical charge might produce a trigger. Call the Peoples emergency hotline when you are in a safe location.</p>
<p>Presented more than a years ago, Uponor ProPEX fittings remain the surest approach for making leak-proof Uponor PEX-a connections quickly and easy.

No need to worry about behind-the-wall connections - ProPEX joints will last the life of the structure.</p>
