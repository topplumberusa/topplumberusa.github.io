<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
