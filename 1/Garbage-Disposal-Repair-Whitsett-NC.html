<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>

<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Whitsett NC</h3>
<p>To determine if your house is a poly home," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it gets in the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is connected to completion of the water main. Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have actually discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Plumbing is an essential part of your house or organisation, and its capability to function is essential. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains obstructing, this might be a sign of a larger issue, like a tree root invasion or a big clog. If the drains clog sometimes but you can typically flush them out, this may be a smaller clog like an accumulation of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap scum from the bathroom. Little blockages can become big ones relatively rapidly.</p>
