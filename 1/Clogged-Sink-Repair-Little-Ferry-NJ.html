Some electrical knowledge is required to make sure the wires are detached correctly. Answer: No! They do not have a sprinkler system, or any outdoor watering system at all, so they do not need backflow prevention.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
