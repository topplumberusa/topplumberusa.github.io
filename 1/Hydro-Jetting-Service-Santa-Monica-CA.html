I picked this company since they had terrific reviews and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it also.</p>
