<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of circulation of water which may bring dirty water or other, dangerous compounds into the public water supply and personal plumbing. Backflow can take place in a number of scenarios that might draw water from places such as garden water fountains, pool, or sprinkler system systems into City water supply lines. If it is connected to any outside water source, Backflow can likewise carry water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with completion left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
<p>One typical method for a house's supply of water to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which could become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem could spread out greatly if that polluted water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in specific residences, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from receding out and polluting the general public water system.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
