<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe in Olive Branch MS 38654</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We advise natural items, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work much better than items consisting of severe chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent guy. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and provided as assured. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
