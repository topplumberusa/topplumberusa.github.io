<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will establish. Sometimes the solution is to repair the broken section of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is needed to solve the concern. Other times a more extensive service is needed: repiping.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>You must always drip cold water into the garbage disposal while crushing foods. Cold water sets greases that have actually been poured in. This makes it smoother for the system to shred them.
