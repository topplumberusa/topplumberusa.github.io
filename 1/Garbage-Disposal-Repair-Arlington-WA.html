<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Arlington WA</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to deal with hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the issue if this is the case. You may need to look into utilizing a high pressure water system to remove the clog. This procedure is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the severity of the clog. There are 2 basic piping products used by plumbing professionals. PEX and copper both use numerous advantages and benefits such as getting rid of the metal taste from your water.</p>
