<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
