It is essential that the repair professional knows the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
