<p>The pipe-bursting approach is utilized on pipes that are severely harmed, for changing an entire pipe system, or for fixing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes two 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe.

The pipe is a plastic product that will be resistant to root invasion for as much as 100 years.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately starts. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regeneration generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
