<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this method, you know the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
<p>Disadvantages to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
