<p>Filtration in sink taps and fridge water dispensers enhances water's taste, however its high price makes it unwise as a household solution.

A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning rip-off.</p>

<p>Depending on your scenario, your plumber may utilize one or a mix of piping material during your house repiping project. Copper is basic because it's long-lasting, can make it through fires, and resists weather. However, copper is tough to install, which means higher labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the benefit of flexibility, which means plumbers can bend the pipes removing the need for joints, which saves time and money and lowers the threat of joint leaks. PEX also resists corrosion and freezing much better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will choose which material is best depending upon your needs.</p>
