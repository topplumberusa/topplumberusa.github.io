<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair Tips and Techniques in Eudora KS 66025</h3>
<p>When you remove the cap to eliminate the valve, examine the washer for wear or fractures. Replacing a bad washer is low-cost and easy. But finding the best washer might not be. The most common washers are typically offered in your home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be tough to discover. Remove it and take it to the shop to discover a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. If it has, you probably have a leak.</p>
