<h3>Hot Water Heater Repair in Leland North Carolina</h2>
<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a new burner set and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself.
