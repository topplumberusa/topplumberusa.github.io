No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola contains a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on. If that does not work then utilize Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (make certain to check out the instructions and security cautions first!). Naval Jelly is what we here at Â® use to get rid of rust spots and it's readily offered at the majority of hardware shops.</p>
