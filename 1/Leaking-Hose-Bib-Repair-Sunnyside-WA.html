<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, that makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a necessity more than a need. When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close appropriately. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
<p>Don't put everything down your garbage disposal. It's important to watch what you put down your waste disposal unit.
