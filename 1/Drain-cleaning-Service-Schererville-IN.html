<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending upon if you utilize PEX, copper, or another product. Changing galvanized pipes in older houses is important because of the way galvanized pipes tend to break down throughout the years. Galvanized pipe is made by covering steel pipe with zinc. As time moves on, the zinc deteriorates, exposing the steel.</p>
