<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Mcdonough GA</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Plumbing is a crucial part of your house or service, and its capability to function is vital. If you experience regular problems with your plumbing, like drains obstructing, this might be a sign of a larger issue, like a tree root invasion or a large clog. If the drains clog periodically however you can typically flush them out, this might be a smaller sized clog like a buildup of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap residue from the bathroom. Little blockages can turn into huge ones fairly quickly.</p>
