<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair professional knows the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly.

Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade.
