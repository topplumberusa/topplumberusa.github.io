<h3>Modern Water Leak Detection Technique in Northampton MA 01060</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
