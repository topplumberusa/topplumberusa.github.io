<p>The appropriate repair of a backflow preventer requires lots of items to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly need to be examined. The installation needs to be assessed to ensure it does not circumvent the operations of the assembly. Test data must be built up to identify the operations of each element. The backflow prevention assembly should be dismantled and parts changed with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be evaluated once again to be sure it was effectively fixed. Comparing the test arises from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the producers flow diagram is needed to guarantee it was fixed effectively. A correctly fixed assembly must offer years of protection.</p>
