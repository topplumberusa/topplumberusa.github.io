<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Our group at All Phase Plumbing likewise utilizes drain cleaning innovation to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also called trenchless pipe lining is a excellent and durable  alternative for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining process includes our group saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. It is pressed through your pipeline when the felt liner is entirely saturated. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all flaws and cracks. If heat is used, the liner is left to solidify in location for several hours or 60 minutes. As soon as the process is total, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be checked one more time to ensure your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
