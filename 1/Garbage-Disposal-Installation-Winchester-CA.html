It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it too.</p>
