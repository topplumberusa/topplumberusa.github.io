<p>Your storm drains don't go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is typically directed elsewhere to a neighboring treatment plant, a creek, or perhaps the ocean in.

<p>Jams-- The disposal might become jammed with food or other items. We can clear jams and help customers know what they ought to not put down their disposals. Just how much does it cost to repipe a house with PEX? About the same rate, although you'll likely pay more since it's a more durable, better quality product.
