<p>Sewer lines have one important role: carry wastewater out of a home or building. The majority of folks replace their water heaters due to poor efficiency, complete failure or as a preventive measure.

These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank runs out of salt, the water passing through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
