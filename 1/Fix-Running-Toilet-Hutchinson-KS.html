<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
