<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are significantly harmed, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes two four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>
<p>You live in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever changed its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon.

You might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one if so. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
