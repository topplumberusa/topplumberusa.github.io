<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin.

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a viable option, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your house and family.</p>
