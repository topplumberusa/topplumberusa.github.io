<p>Changing your sink is a detailed procedure. Step, cut, and connect the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be used. Though it might require extra adapters, versatile tubing is far much easier to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
