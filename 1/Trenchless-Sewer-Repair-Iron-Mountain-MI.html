<p>The most effective method to attend to tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>It's a great concept to arrange annual inspections if your plumbing system is years old and if you know that you have a history of blocking or leaking. Test. Contact a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List to check the backflow assembly. The tester will submit the results to us.
