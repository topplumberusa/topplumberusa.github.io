It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had great reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it also.</p>
