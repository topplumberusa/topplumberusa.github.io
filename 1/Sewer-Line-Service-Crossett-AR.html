A set up backflow preventer (blue device, center) protects the public water system from contamination.

<p>Tank to Tank installation: Typically, changing a gas or electric water tank with a comparable design takes two to three hours. It takes in between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, disconnect and remove your old hot water heater.

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
