<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy salt water option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank lacks salt, the water going through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
