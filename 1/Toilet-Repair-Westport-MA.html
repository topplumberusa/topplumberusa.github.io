If your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth, you ought to wait up until after the cycle is finished and after that inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings. You should also check to ensure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
