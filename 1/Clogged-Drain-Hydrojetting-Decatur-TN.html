<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind versus a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
