<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
