PEX is resistant to rust, scaling, and chlorine and the pipes can be pieced together without joints or elbows.</p>
<p>While battling a fire, firefighters are understandably more concerned about drawing adequate water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they utilize water from any readily available source to accomplish their objective, however fire department vehicles frequently carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, rust inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing License and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger water pipes to lose pressure. When that takes place, water is no longer pushed forward into the residential or commercial property, allowing it to flow backwards into city water supplies.</p>
