<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Great Bend KS</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
