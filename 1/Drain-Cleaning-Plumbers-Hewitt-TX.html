<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending upon the product. To keep your health, home, and security convenience, we use only the best piping: polyethylene.

Copper is also typically utilized because of its longevity and safer building, but polyethylene piping lasts longer than anything on the marketplace and ensures the healthiest and cleanest water flow.</p>
