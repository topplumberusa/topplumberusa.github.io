Gas is one of the most common and affordable forms of energy to residential consumers. Although fairly safe and extremely efficient, consumers of gas need to understand possible risks to much better secure their households and homes.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
<p>One common way for a house's water system to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which could end up being tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem could spread out significantly if that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in individual houses, it also prevents wastewater in personal homes from flowing back out and polluting the general public supply of water.</p>
