<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently lift the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted correctly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to clogs with food and grease being the significant culprits. If fats are poured down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls as well. Even tree roots can develop serious drain obstructions by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water flow, requiring plumbers to find and repair the problem for regular home plumbing operations. If this is what is occurring to your home, you need your drain cleaned up before it leads to more damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
