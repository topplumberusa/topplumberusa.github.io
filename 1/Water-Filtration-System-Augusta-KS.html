<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing set up throughout building and construction of a new or renovated structure is set up by well-informed craftsmen in accordance with appropriate codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you usually understand your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. Nevertheless, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is probably in the draining component itself. Clogs in a fixture can cause harmful damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are required to perform website inspections to identify if a backflow prevention device is required as a result of a actual or possible  cross-connection threat on a consumer's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections found on Vashon Island are only carried out on Wednesdays. Spot Repairs: Using one or a mix of the above services, we will fix the problems we discover with the camera inspection directly without uprooting anymore than we need to.</p>

It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had excellent reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it too.</p>
