<p>If a cable television has not yet been gone to the junction box, you can make the connections within the brand-new disposer any time ahead of time, signing up with the cable television to the wires in package prior to or simply after installing the disposer. Garbage disposals are quite easy to maintain. The most important thing to bear in mind is that they are really food disposals. Items that would otherwise enter the garbage must not be placed in your disposal. This includes glass, plastic, metals (yes, flatware), paper, anything combustible, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
