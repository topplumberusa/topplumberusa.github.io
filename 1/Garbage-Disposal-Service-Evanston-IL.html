<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the structure; extra, more substantial expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for citizens. If installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help identify.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main sewage systems traverse private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to prevent backflow. The basic ways of preventing backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The basic system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.</p>
