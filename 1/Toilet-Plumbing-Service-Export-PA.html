A hot water heater is basically a household home appliance that consists of a gas or electric heating system under a tank in which water is heated up and stored. You do not need a plumbing license for simple repairs such as unclogging a sink or if a plumbing license is issued as part of a bigger residential structure permit or commercial structure permit.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
