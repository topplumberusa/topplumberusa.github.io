This repair method is typically utilized to replace the old pipe with a comparable or larger pipe.</p>

<p>If you've ever been frustrated by cloudy white spots on your dishes that will not disappear, white shirts that turn gray and dull after a couple of washes, or a stubborn layer of soap scum in your shower, you'll more than happy to know that water softening can get rid of these problems and more.
