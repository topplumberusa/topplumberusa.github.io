<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific guy. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as promised. I will definitely use Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit.
