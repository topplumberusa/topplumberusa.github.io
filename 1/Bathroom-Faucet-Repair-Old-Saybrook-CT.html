<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
