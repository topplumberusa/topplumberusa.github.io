<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are installed in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>You live in an older home. There's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually installed in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are known to rust and burst when they get old. You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one if so. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
