<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is warmed directly whenever it's required. Tankless systems specifically utilize an element that heats up water when the tap is turned on. The water is continuously warmed as long as the tap stays on. If the tap is immediately switched off, the water stops being warmed. The heating temperature is typically pre-set to fit your choices and requirements. Due to the fact that they just heat water when needed, tankless electrical water heaters utilize less power than traditional water heaters.</p>
