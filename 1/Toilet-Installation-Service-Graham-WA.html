The pink film is actually a safe bacteria that originates from the sea salt. If this stain is an inconvenience in your house, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends changing to among the other 2 types of salts. Once the new salt has had a chance to entirely replace the solar salt in your system, then buy some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as instructed in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>
