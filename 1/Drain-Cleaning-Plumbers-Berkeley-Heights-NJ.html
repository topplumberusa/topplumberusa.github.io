Solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may require extra adapters, versatile tubing is far simpler to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
