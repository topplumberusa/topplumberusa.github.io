<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
