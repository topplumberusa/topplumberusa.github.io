<p>Backflow preventers are a fairly easy system, in spite of their value. The majority of commercial use backflow prevention setups use a valve system that gets in touch with the irrigation line within your company, where irrigation meets the main water supply. From here, the preventer can monitor the motion of water within your system, and avoid any possible back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be caused by malfunctioning plumbing devices.
