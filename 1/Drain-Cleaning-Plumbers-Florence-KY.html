<p>So, what's a backflow prevention valve? This is a device that ensures non-potable water does not get back into the main supply of water system. Put simply, it's a device that ensures water circulations in one direction. You'll want the sewer repair process to decrease disturbances to your residential or commercial property or service when you have a sewer issue. You probably do not want to collect your patio area, car park or landscape.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
