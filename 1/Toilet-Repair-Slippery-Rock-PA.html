When you have a sewer issue, you'll desire the sewer repair process to reduce disruptions to your residential or commercial property or organisation. You most likely do not wish to dig up your patio area, parking lot or landscape.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the perpetrator. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper.

Image 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
