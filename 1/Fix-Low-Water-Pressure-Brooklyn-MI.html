<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Condensation: Shortened to TAC, this approach uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation website where solidity mineral ions are changed into a steady crystalline kind that will not cling to surface areas. These crystals are microscopic and circulation typically through the water. Unlike with a softener that uses ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require continuous regeneration.</p>
