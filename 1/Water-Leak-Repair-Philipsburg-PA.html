Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have actually been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
