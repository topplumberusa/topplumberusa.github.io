It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be gotten rid of from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
