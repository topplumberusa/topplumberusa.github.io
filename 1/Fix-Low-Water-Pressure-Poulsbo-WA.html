<p>Over time that ground settles and when it does you run the extremely real risk of the sewer line shearing at the foundation wall. The piping drops and a clog occurs. Many times this issue can go on for years without a devastating backup happening however, it will occur sooner or later. Having your sewer line video examined gives you some piece of mind and it can save you some lots of money in the long run.</p>
<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair specialist understands the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
