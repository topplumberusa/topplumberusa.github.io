<p>Water system by the public utility consists of some amounts of hazardous chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems get rid of these pollutants to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are necessary requirements, not optional expenses. A house plumbing inspection will either be visual, made with a camera, or a mix of both.</p>
<p>Some property owners might consider water softeners as a high-end item, something that's good to have" however not entirely required. However, difficult water can trigger everything from small annoyances, like spots on dishes or soap scum, to significant problems like a shorter life expectancy for your water heater, dishwasher, and other vital home appliances. For these factors and others, a water softener can be a helpful investment for your house.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
