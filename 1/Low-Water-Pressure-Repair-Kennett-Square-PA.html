<p>When you eliminate the cap to eliminate the valve, check the washer for wear or fractures. Replacing a bad washer is simple and inexpensive. But finding the best washer might not be. The most common washers are often readily available at home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be hard to find. Eliminate it and take it to the store to discover a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
