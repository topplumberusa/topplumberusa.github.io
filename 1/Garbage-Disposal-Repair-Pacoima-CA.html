<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation.
