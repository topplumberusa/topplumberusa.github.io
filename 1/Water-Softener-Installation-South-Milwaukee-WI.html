<p>Disadvantages to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
