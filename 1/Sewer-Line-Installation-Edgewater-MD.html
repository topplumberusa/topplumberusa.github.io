<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>

<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

<p>Like any household appliance, water heaters need regular maintenance to run safely and effectively. Regular water heater maintenance can also extend the life of the home appliance and help avoid other problems or unanticipated leakages. The maintenance necessary for your hot water heater depends on area, style of the system, quality of installation, water quality, and maker recommendations. Seek advice from your local Roto-Rooter plumber to develop a water heater maintenance schedule that will optimize the life of your appliance.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are frequently called on-demand hot water heater. These water heating systems produce warm water as it is required by heating the water that streams from your water main to your tap, bypassing the need for a tank. A tankless water heater typically costs less to run over its lifetime, but typically costs more upfront than tank hot water heater. Depending on your needs, you may need more than one tankless water heater to meet your everyday hot water demands.</p>
