<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Cannon Falls MN</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Since of the inherent design of a decreased pressure backflow assembly, varying supply pressure on an incredibly low flow or static flow condition might trigger problem leaking and possible fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of changing supply pressure.</p>
