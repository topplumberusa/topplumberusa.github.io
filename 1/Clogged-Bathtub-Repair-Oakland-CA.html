Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
