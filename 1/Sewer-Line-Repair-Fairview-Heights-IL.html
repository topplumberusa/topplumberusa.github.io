Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property.
