Another suggestion to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
