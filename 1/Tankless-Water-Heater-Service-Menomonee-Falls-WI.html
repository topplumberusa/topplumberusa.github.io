<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>

<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades.

When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
