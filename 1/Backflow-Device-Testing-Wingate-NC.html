<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This rust, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc.
