Copper is standard due to the fact that it's lasting, can survive fires, and resists weather. However, copper is difficult to install, which indicates higher labor expenses. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the benefit of versatility, which suggests plumbers can flex the pipes eliminating the need for joints, which saves money and time and decreases the threat of joint leakages. PEX also resists corrosion and freezing much better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which product is best depending on your needs.</p>

If so, you might need to include a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you don't already have one. This usually includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
