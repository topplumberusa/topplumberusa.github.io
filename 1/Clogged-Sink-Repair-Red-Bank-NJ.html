<p>If you are wanting to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually begun to leak, first consider your options. A full sewer pipe replacement might not be required. Typically, relining your existing pipes is a much better alternative. If your sewer lines are underneath trees, near extensive landscaping, pathways, driveways or other semi-permanent features, overall sewer excavation can cause a great deal of collateral damage (and expenditure) to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
