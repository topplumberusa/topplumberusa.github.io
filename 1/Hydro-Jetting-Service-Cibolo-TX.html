<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
