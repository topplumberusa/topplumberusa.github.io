<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
