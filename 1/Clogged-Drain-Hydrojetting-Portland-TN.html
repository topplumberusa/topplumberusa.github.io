<p>Before the repair service technician starts the repair procedure, he should make sure he has evaluated the work area around the backflow prevention assembly in order to determine any limiting conditions. Appropriate security preventative measures should be followed for appropriate entry if the area is considered a restricted area. A safe and proper work environment might require the positioning of security barriers or entry restrictions around the work area so the repair professional or the general public around your work area are not damaged. This might affect the technician's ability to successfully finish the repair if the backflow preventer is set up in a restrictive area.</p>
