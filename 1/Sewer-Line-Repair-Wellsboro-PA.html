Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not include any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also known as trenchless pipe lining is a long lasting and exceptional option for your broken pipes. The pipe lining procedure includes our group saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. It is pushed through your pipeline when the felt liner is entirely saturated. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all imperfections and cracks. If heat is utilized, the liner is left to harden in place for several hours or 60 minutes.
