<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Greenville MI</h3>
<p>To figure out if your home is a poly house," begin with the outside. Underground water mains are usually blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it goes into the home near the hot water heater. Your main turned off is attached to completion of the water pipe. Ensure you check both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>This is extremely crucial! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system. Existing policies restrict the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines. We offer two types of water treatment systems for difficult water: Benefit Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
