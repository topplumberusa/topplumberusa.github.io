<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
