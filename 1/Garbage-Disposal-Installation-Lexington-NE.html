<h2>Tips To Hire Emergency Plumbing Contractors in Lexington</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively remove hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
