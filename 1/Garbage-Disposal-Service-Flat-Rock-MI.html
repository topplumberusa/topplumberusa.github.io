<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or permanent connection in between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indicator the tank is failing and will need to be changed. Schedule a quote as quickly as possible and make sure nothing is near the heater that might be potentially harmed if it is in a garage and a small slow leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst triggering water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
