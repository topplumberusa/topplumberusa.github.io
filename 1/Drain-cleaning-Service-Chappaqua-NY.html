<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it might need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
