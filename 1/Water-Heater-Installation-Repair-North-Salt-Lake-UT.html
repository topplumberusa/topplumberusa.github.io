The city or Uruk consists of the earliest known examples of brick built Latrines, built atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later on used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had easily removable and changeable segments, and allowed for cleaning.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical substance that serves as a chelating agent.
