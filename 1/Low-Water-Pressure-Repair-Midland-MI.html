<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
