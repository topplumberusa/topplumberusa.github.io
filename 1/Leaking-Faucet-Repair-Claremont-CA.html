Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
