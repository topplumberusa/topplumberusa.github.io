<p>Aside from these two essential elements, there are a myriad of small, maybe less important things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
