<p>The secret to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there need to be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you ought to probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
