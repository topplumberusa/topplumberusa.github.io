<p>Depending on your scenario, your plumber may use one or a combination of piping material throughout your home repiping job. Copper is basic since it's lasting, can make it through fires, and withstands weather. However, copper is difficult to install, which indicates greater labor costs.

PEX likewise resists deterioration and freezing much better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will choose which material is best depending on your needs.</p>
