<p>Plumbers install and repair water, gas, and other piping systems in homes, organisations, and factories. They install plumbing fixtures, such as bath tubs and toilets, and devices, such as dishwashers and water heaters. They clean drains, remove blockages, and repair or replace broken pipes and components. Plumbers also help maintain septic systems-- large, underground holding tanks that gather waste from houses that are not connected to a sewer system.</p>
<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
