Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promo have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
