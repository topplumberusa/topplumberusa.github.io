<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of little, maybe less vital things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
