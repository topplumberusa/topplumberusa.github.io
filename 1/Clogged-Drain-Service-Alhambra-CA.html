<p>The source or place of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another.

Easements (usually 10 feet large) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water system line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions.

Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the primary supply of water system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
