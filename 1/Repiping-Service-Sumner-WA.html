<p>A cross-connection is any short-lived or long-term connection between a public water supply or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water system or consumer's potable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an undesirable flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries impurities back to the primary water system system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
