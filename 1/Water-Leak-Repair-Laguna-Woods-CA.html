<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
