<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
