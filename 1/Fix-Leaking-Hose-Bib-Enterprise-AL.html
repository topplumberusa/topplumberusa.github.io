<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Enterprise AL 36330</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
