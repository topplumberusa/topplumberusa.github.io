<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or certification requirements for a lot of construction contractors (or their employees). The key to the technology is being able to control both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, consequently eliminating firmness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active websites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This innovation is more cost reliable and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers improves water's taste, but its high price tag makes it not practical as a household solution. Packaged chemicals soften water in small batches, such as washing machine loads, but render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothing, and, in many cases, contain phosphates that damage the environment. A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning rip-off.</p>
