Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure.
