<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab.

Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly.
