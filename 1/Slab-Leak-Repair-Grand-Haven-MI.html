<p>Burst Pipe Hydraulic Replacement - Like pipe relining, this also does not involve digging and replacing. Instead, our technicians use a rupturing tool that forces the existing pipeline to burst" and break apart. A new pipeline is instantly pulled in and completes deep space developed by the old, burst pipe in a commercial or residential sewer. This repair method is usually used to replace the old pipe with a similar or larger pipe.</p>

<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or momentary connection between a public water system or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or customer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the main water system system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
