Another tip to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
