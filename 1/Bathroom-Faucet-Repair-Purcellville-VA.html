When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>

We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
