<p>With PVC you have a number of options if your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering an interruption. The other is to go ahead and replace the entire line. If the line is about 40 years of ages and is showing indications of age throughout, absolutely replace. Nowadays, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it might be an acceptable option to do just that. However, if the balanced out worsens trenchless may no longer be an option.</p>
