<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to find.</p>

PEX likewise resists corrosion and freezing much better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which material is best depending on your requirements.</p>
