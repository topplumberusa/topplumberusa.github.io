Transplant these plants, if possible, to keep roots far from your plumbing. Underground pipes can be pricey to replace or repair.</p>
<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible amount, there ought to be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you should probably not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
