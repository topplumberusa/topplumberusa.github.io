<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the flow of water pushing them down your pipes.

<p>The most typical approach for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, normally sodium. Sodium won't cause lime scale or soap residue accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening includes only a very small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is thought about very low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
