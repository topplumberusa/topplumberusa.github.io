<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
