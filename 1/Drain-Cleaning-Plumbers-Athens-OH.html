<p>Aside from these two crucial components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
