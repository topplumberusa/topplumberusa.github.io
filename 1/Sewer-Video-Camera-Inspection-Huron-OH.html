<p>Numerous homeowners think their utility companies or property owners insurance coverage is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, however the truth is that oftentimes you, the property owner, are responsible. Many fundamental homeowners insurance plan and local utility companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the major systems around your home.</p>
<p>Supply of water by the water company includes some amounts of damaging chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems eliminate these pollutants to make drinking water clean, clear and more delicious. As such, water filtration systems are important requirements, not optional costs.
