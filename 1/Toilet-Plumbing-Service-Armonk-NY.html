<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very important part of the design of each part. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the part, which could cause the element to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
