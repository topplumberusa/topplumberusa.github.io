<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>

<p>Numerous homeowners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their clogged or unclean drain concerns. These chemicals are easy to use and low-cost, but they damage your pipes and their effects are only short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use extreme chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with duplicated use, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe creating weak points that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always advised.</p>

Place a bucket underneath the area to catch water then loosen the two threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place. Nowadays, many kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
