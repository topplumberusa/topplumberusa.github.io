<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair technician understands the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>Think of all the areas water streams in and out of your house. These are the areas that a professional evaluation should cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other devices. Even your water lines must be covered.

After all, excessive pressure can harm your plumbing, and too little can leave your home with dysfunctional water home appliances.</p>
