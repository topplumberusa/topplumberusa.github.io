If you are presently experiencing any flooding on your home when it rains, then there is a great chance that the storm drain is clogged and for that reason needs to be cleared out. If a clogged storm drain is not attended to in a timely way, the opportunities are high that it will cause extra damage to the storm pipe, which will need repair.</p>
<p>Rusting and corrosion on the outside of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can show a prospective issue with the hot water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can also indicate the water heater is near the end of its life. With heavy deterioration buildup on valves for water lines to and from the heater, it could indicate that there have actually been changes in pressure triggering small leakages.</p>
