<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to clogs with food and grease being the significant culprits. If fats are put down the sink, they cake to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls also. Even tree roots can create severe drain clogs by wrapping around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water flow, requiring plumbers to discover and repair the problem for regular home plumbing operations. If this is what is taking place to your home, you need your drain cleaned before it causes more damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
