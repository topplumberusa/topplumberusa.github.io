<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are looked for leakages or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed immediately. Before you can request an inspection, you need to first get the required permit( s) for the work you intend to do. You can check out our Authorization page for more details on obtaining an authorization. Once you get an authorization you can start with the work. However, you must call for inspection before you hide any work or cover.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to present a chemical substance that functions as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water rather than building up on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they stay in one place for long, as they may in a water heater, the buildup might still take place.</p>

Routine water heater maintenance can also extend the life of the appliance and aid avoid unanticipated leaks or other problems. The maintenance required for your hot water heater depends upon area, design of the system, quality of installation, water quality, and producer recommendations. Talk to your local Roto-Rooter plumber to develop a water heater maintenance schedule that will maximize the life of your device.</p>
