<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>
