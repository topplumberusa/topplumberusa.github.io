<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
