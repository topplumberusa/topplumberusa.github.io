<p>A waste disposal unit need to not leak. It generally indicates wear and tear which is a reasonable sign that its time is up when this takes place. If you think of what you put down the disposal, leakages can be unhygienic and will also eventually trigger pressure on other parts of your waste disposal unit. The kitchen sink drain may need a simple tightening up or a replacement. If the leak is in the pressurized hose spray, you will see the apparent spray.
