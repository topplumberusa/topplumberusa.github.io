<p>Sewer lines have one vital role: bring wastewater out of a house or building. The following is a list of the drain cleaning & repair services we provide.

<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this accreditation.

<h3>Water Heater Replacement in Hazleton Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>If you experience blockages and backups in your home more than a couple of times, it's a great idea to have a professional examine your drain system.

The camera can locate and identify the problem so the drain can be fixed.</p>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your backyard. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
