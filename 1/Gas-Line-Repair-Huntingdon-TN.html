<p>Strange Sounds - If unusual gurgling is coming from your drain, it most likely requires a thorough cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to travel through. The pipes frequently make odd gurgling sounds as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe due to the fact that of the tight area. This triggers the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are available, leading to the unusual noises emanating from your sink.</p>
