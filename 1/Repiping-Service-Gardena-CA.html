<p>As soon as the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be removed from the body.
