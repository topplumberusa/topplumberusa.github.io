Lacking hot water rapidly is another indication of sediment build-up, since the sediment is taking up more area in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
<p>High water pressure also harms plumbing. The water entering into the home puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water shut down valves and supply lines, and toilets. High water pressure results in leaks, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to happen without proper pressure reduction. You can also save money on salt, water, and energy by using as much as 50% less cleaning agent for laundry and dish-washing, using up to 34% less salt and as much as 35% less water throughout regeneration.</p>
