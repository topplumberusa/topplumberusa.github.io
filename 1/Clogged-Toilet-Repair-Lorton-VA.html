These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom.
