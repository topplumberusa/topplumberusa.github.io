<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and intricate plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a challenging job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
