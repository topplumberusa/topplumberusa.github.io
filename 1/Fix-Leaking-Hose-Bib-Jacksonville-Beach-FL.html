<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of circulation in a safe and clean water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just stream in one instructions. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly stream toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The need upstream might cause a reversal in circulation.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's changed properly (Picture 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to obstructions with food and grease being the major offenders. They congeal to the piping walls if fats are put down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls as well. Even tree roots can produce major drain clogs by wrapping around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water flow, requiring plumbers to discover and repair the issue for normal house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned up before it leads to further damage and even costlier repairs if this is what is occurring to your house.</p>
