Most of toilets are standard sized - implying a "will fit" seat suffices for security and comfort. Some toilets, however, have distinctively formed bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It actually isn't a great idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to little, unless they have been particularly designed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or won't disperse your weight uniformly and might eventually cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
