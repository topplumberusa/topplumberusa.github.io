<h3>Necessity of Sewer Line Inspection in Narberth PA 19072 and Its Procedures</h3>
<p>It is not constantly due to clogs that come from inside the house when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also called tree root intrusion. When tree roots begin to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The kind of drain pipes currently installed, such as cast iron, plastic, clay or copper, will identify the level of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>

<p>The source or area of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another.
