<p>If you think your toilet has a leak, the bright side is that it doesn't necessarily require a repair of your entire unit. A toilet's tank is composed of several small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their frequent use. When these parts wear, they result in small leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
