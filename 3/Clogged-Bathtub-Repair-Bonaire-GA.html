If you've attempted to unclog a bathroom or kitchen sink without any luck, it might be time to call a professional plumber. They can determine the location of the blockage and the very best ways to unclog the traffic jam without harming your plumbing.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
