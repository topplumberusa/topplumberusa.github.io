<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the public water supply and private on-site water system and distribution systems by restricting cross-connections in between potable (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of main and secondary backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow approaches provide an increased level of defense for the public water system system.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

<p>The old disposal has to be detached first. Garbage disposals are normally linked at the base and so this is where the process begins.
