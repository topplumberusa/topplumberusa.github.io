<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Assures? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
