<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet at New Albany IN 47150</h3>
<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of small, maybe less crucial things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
