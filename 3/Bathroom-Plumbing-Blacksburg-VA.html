Difficult water disrupts the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, triggering you to utilize more. Hard water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that tough water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden typically.</p>
