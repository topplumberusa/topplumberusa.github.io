<p>3. Solar Salt comes from vaporized seawater and may in some cases leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs. The pink film is really a harmless bacteria that originates from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends changing to one of the other 2 types of salts if this stain is an inconvenience in your home.
