<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to find.</p>
<p>Is your home 50+ years of ages? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the main material used in plumbing.
