<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to identify.</p>
<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates service technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your home. The camera is by hand controlled on a versatile rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor.

The info we glean from the inspection permits us to make an informed choice concerning the condition of your pipes and advise the very best solution too. We can make the ideal recommendation with confidence if the pipe needs to be cleaned of blockages or relined with epoxy resin.</p>
