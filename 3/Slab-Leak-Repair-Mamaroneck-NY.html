The majority of toilets are standard sized - indicating a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and convenience. Some toilets, however, have uniquely shaped bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It truly isn't a great concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have been specifically designed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or will not distribute your weight equally and might ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
