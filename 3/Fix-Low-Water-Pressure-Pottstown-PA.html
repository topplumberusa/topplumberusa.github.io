<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

<p>Hydro jetting is among many trenchless services available to you, accessible through North Georgia Inliner. Hydro jetting is the use of hot, highly pressurized water through a protected hose and nozzle to clear any and all clogs. This procedure is somewhat more eco-friendly than snaking given that it only utilizes water, which your pipes are used to handling. It also saves you cash and time because a second inspection isn't essential.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings impurities back to the primary water supply system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
