Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly flow toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The need upstream might trigger a reversal in flow.</p>
