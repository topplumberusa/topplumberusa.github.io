<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a need more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on really gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close effectively. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Each element of the assembly should be evaluated to identify what is in need of repair. The field test might not constantly show you the severity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the fundamental rubber repair set are required. There may be extra test procedures, beyond those established in the tester certification program, that can supply data revealing the severity of the failure that might help in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>

It is important that the repair service technician understands the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
