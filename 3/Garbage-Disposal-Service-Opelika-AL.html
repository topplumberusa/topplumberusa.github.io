<p>This might seem like a joke, but it's really serious if you want to genuinely get the most out of your investment. Start by requesting for a copy of the plumbing inspection list.

<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
