Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
