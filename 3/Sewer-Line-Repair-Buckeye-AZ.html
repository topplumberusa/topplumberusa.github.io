<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with property owners in the area. He noted that there are specific pollutants that homeowners are handling and an RO can help alleviate those concerns. Due to being largely farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally occurs in some soils which too can be corrected with the best RO system.</p>
<p>One typical way for a home's water supply to be infected is if the irrigation water lines, which could become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem could spread out greatly if that polluted water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in specific houses, it also prevents wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and contaminating the public water supply.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and then return to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles however will lose more water and salt since they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, generally regenerate after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
