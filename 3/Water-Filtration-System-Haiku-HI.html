You, for that reason, need to use a growing number of cleaning agent to accomplish the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and sanitized during regeneration. Finally, water containing the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
