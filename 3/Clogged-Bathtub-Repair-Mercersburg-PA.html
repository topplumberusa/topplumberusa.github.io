<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Mercersburg PA</h3>
<p>The Plumbers Connection can unclog your storm drain systems with the use of a hydrojetting machine. The hydrojet has a spinning head on the head that releases a really high pressure stream of water. The quickly swirling water has the ability to jet" through the toughest of clogs consisting of mud, leaves, branches, garbage and more. The end result is a storm drain system that is clean and free of particles and prepared for service.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as tough water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
