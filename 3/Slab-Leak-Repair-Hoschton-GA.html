<h3>Basic Methods for Refrigerant Leak Detection in Hoschton GA 30548</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>While battling a fire, firefighters are understandably more concerned about drawing sufficient water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any available source to attain their objective, however fire department vehicles often bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, corrosion inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
