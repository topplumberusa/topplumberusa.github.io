<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Companies in Newton</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Dual Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers offered that you might run into. The very first is a check valve. The 2nd is a double check". It is NOT the exact same thing as a Double Check even though it may be marketed as one! Do not get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses comparable to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>
