<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. Due to the fact that they restore whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually restore after many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a changing water utilize schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
