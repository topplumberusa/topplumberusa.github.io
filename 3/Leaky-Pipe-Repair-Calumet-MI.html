However, the majority of toilet repairs are simple and easy tasks - such as replacing a used flapper - that the majority of people can do themselves in about 5 minutes.

<p>The excellent news is that it doesn't necessarily need a repair of your whole system if you presume your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is composed of several small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or repaired due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear, they lead to tiny leakages that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as soon as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
