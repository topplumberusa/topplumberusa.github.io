However, the majority of toilet repairs are simple and easy tasks - such as replacing a used flapper - that the majority of people can do themselves in about 5 minutes.

When these parts wear, they lead to tiny leakages that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as soon as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
