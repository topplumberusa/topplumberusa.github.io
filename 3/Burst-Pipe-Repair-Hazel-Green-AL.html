<p>When the potable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may happen. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not effectively safeguarded, non-potable and potable water or liquids can be pushed into the drinkable supply system.</p>

<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing detergent from working effectively because hard water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to use more and more cleaning agent to achieve the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and sanitized throughout regeneration. Lastly, water consisting of the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
