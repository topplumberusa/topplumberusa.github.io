Our repair processes rely on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections triggered by waste accumulation can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls properly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a thorough cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The unique nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to permit the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and supply a mindful cleaning.</p>
