<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over a time period the within lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a small pinhole leak will develop. Often the service is to repair the broken area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is needed to resolve the problem. Other times a more comprehensive service is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>Water solidity is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the distinction on your skin is due to the fact that soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue.
