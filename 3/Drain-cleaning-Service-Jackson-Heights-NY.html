<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a need more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be examined to ensure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close properly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

I have actually contacted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the cost to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
