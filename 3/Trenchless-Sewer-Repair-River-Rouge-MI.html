<p>Hot water heater diagnostics: We identify what is wrong with your hot water heater, in addition to what maintenance work needs to be performed moving on. Water softeners normally utilize salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are supplied from liquified sodium chloride salt, also called brine. In the ion exchange procedure, sodium ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that resemble wet sand.</p>
<p>GGP is always prepared to repair any of these types of sinks. Ought to you experience a specialized faucet repair that requires special order parts, we can put the order and get the sink repaired as soon as the part shows up. Ion exchange resins, in the type of beads, are a functional component of domestic water softening units.

<p>A cross-connection is any temporary or long-term connection in between a public water system or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
