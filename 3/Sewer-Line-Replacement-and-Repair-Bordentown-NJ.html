<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
