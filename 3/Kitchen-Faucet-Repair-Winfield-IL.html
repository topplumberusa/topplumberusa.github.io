<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Winfield IL</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>Was your home constructed before the 1970s and has not gone through improvement or pipe replacement? It is likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another product which has actually corroded and decayed over the years if so. Older pipes can trigger significant leakages and even infect your water as they decay. Even the highest quality pipes won't last permanently and will need to be changed.</p>
