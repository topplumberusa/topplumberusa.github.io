<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Everyday usage ought to not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can likewise take place if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the unit in a stable and safe location.
