Take it out entirely and clean it completely if the trap continues to leak. You can choose to clear the drain with the help of an auger if you believe a clog. If your sink is blocked, water will drain very slowly; drawing from a minute or two, to even 10.</p>
<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to many carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener. Normally, this is because the system is obsoleted or not working effectively. Whatever the factor, you can be missing out on the advantages of soft water without even knowing it.</p>

A PRV will control water pressure as it comes into the house.
