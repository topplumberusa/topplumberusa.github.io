<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a very vital part of the style of each component. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities.
