The pink film is in fact a harmless bacteria that comes from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests changing to one of the other two types of salts if this stain is an annoyance in your house. When the brand-new salt has actually had a chance to completely replace the solar salt in your system, then buy some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as advised in your owner's manual or on the cleaner label.</p>
