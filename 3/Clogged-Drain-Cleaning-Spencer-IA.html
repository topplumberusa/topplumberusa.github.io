<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a feasible option, specifically when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous downsides to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>
