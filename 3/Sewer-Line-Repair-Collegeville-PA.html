<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help determine.</p>
