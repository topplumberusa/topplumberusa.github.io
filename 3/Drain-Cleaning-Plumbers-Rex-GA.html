<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the level of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
