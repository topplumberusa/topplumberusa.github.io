For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly.

Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.
