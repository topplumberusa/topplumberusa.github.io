The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.

A PE or RA can help figure out if setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>

A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in private homes, it likewise prevents wastewater in personal homes from receding out and contaminating the general public water supply.</p>
