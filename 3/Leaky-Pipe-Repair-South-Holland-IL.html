<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Company in South Holland</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
