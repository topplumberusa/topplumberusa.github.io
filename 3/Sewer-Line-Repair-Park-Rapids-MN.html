<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually preserved at a significant pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might fail or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>It's a great concept to arrange yearly inspections if your plumbing system is years old and if you know that you have a history of blocking or leaking. Test. Contact a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List to check the backflow assembly. The tester will send the results to us.
