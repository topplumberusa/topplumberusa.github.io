<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to find.</p>
