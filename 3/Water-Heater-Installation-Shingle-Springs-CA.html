<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line obstructions are not something a homeowner can fix. This type of clog requires a professional plumber or drain service technician to utilize a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this kind of camera to recognize and repair the drain issue. If you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is specifically useful in locating a problem.</p>

<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
