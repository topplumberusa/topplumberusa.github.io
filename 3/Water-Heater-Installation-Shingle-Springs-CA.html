<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
