<p>Damage control is an issue. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I face circumstances, frequently that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the task.

Just look on line. The problem does exist.</p>

<p>Irreversible magnetic water conditioning gadgets have actually been marketed based upon a range of claims concerning their impact on water hardness and related scale development. The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment market, has not been able to identify standards for these items and report inconsistent performance to date. Research has shown no change happens in the chemical and physical homes or the calcium ion concentration of water treated with the devices (The Water Quality Association Magnetics Task Force, 2001).</p>
<p>As soon as installed, these BPAs are subject to preliminary and periodic testing and maintenance requirements to validate their continued functional effectiveness.
