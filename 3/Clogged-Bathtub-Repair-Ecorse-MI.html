For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>

This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
