<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Assures? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth).

The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
