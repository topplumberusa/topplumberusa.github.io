<p>Lots of property owners think their energy companies or property owners insurance is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, but the reality is that in a lot of cases you, the homeowner, are responsible. A lot of standard property owners insurance policies and local energy companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the significant systems in and around your house.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Security Systems for carrying out annual forward flow tests are sometimes viewed as a mandate to have them.
