<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
