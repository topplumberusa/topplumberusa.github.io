<p>This might sound like a joke, however it's really severe if you want to genuinely get the most out of your financial investment. Start by asking for a copy of the plumbing inspection list.

<p>Disadvantages to be familiar with is that hybrid hot water heater need to be installed in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
