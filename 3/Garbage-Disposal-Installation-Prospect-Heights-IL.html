<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to avoid winter freezing. The brand-new pipe, made from a high-tech, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall material are removed to attach the pipes to the water components, Wood says. Depending on the scope of work being performed and the kind of building, you may have several inspections.</p>
<p>Soap - Soap develops down the drain since they generally contain grease and fat. When the fat of the soap integrates with mineral water, it forms a strong residue and sticks to the pipes, clogging them.
