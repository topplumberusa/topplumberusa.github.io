<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

Trenchless pipe repair is a kind of pipe repair that does not include any excavation.
