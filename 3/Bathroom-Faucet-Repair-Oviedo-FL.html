<p>Surface Area Accelerated Condensation is a development that imitates biomineralization, the mechanism commonly acknowledged for structured growth in the environment, consisting of seashells. Water softening is accomplished with SACr by utilizing exclusive polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads speed up the growth of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to totally get rid of temporary firmness in water.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Formation: Reduced to TAC, this technique utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where hardness mineral ions are changed into a steady crystalline kind that will not cling to surfaces. These crystals are microscopic and circulation typically through the water. Unlike with a softener that uses ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need continuous regrowth.</p>
