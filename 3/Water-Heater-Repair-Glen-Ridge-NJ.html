<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This rust, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can likewise indicate the water heater is near the end of its life. With heavy deterioration buildup on valves for water lines to and from the heater, it might suggest that there have been changes in pressure triggering little leakages.</p>
