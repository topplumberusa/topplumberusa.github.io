Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
