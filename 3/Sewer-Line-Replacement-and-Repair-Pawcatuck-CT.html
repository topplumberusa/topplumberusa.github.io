<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Contractor in Pawcatuck</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to weld or spot a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to save money. While this might work in the short term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made of the very same product as other pipes in your home, meaning that problem might be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you peace of mind and avoid larger leaks down the roadway.</p>
