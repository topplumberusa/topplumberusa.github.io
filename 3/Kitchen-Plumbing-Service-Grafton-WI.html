<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can happen with time from the accumulation of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that collects inside of pipes. As a clog becomes bigger over time, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining effectively. You can fight tough water in different ways, including filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, adding a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (salt carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
<p>When we manage your gas or lp pipe installation and gas pipe repair, you can unwind and use your gas piping with no concern. While water overuse is a concern for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regeneration process. That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>If you've ever been frustrated by cloudy white areas on your meals that won't go away, white t-shirts that turn dull and gray after a couple of washes, or a stubborn layer of soap scum in your shower, you'll be happy to understand that water softening can get rid of these problems and more. Difficult water causes these problems due to the minerals in the water that are left behind after a wash. With softened water, you won't need to worry about any concerns with mineral deposits sticking around. This makes chores much easier and less frustrating for everybody included.</p>
