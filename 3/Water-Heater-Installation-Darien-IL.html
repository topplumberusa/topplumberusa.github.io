In your house, so much water cleans through the drains, as well as dirt, debris, hair, and other particles. With time, this can all build up.

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages.
