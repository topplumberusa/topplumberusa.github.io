<p>Depending upon your circumstance, your plumber might use one or a combination of piping material throughout your house repiping task. Copper is standard since it's long-lasting, can make it through fires, and withstands weather. However, copper is challenging to install, which implies higher labor expenses. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of versatility, which means plumbers can bend the pipes eliminating the need for joints, which saves money and time and decreases the threat of joint leakages. PEX also resists deterioration and freezing much better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which product is best depending on your requirements.</p>

That detergent cost savings increases to nearly 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>
