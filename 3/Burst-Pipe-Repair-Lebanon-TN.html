Most garbage disposals are plug-in, as it is safer to have a vibrating system come unplugged then disconnected from stationary wiring. Nevertheless, some sinks do not have a plug-in installed beneath, and it might take an electrician and even permits to get one installed on its own devoted circuit.</p>
