<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Tuscaloosa AL</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had fantastic reviews and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
