<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>We focus on repair, service and installation of all makes and models of gas hot water heater, electrical hot water heater and tankless water heaters.
