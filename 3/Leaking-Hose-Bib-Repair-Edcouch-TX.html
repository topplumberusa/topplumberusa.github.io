It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
