<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
