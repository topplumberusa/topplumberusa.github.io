Check for leaks under the sink to validate that your plumber's putty is making an excellent seal. Eliminate the drain stopper, and permit the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leaks and tighten as required. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cords as desired.</p>
<p>Without a plumbing camera inspection, many drain issues can only be detected once they begin to back up. But, during routing plumbing inspections, a full test of all drains will be performed. If something may be taking place behind the walls or in the ground, plumbers can attempt to recreate problems to figure out. Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is much more effective at eliminating obstructions. Many homes have drain cleanouts, however, we come across older homes without cleanouts.
