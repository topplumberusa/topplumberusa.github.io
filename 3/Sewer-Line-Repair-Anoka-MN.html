<p>You live in an older home. There's a great possibility that you'll need to have it done quickly if your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and corrode when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
