<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Sturgis SD</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to attend to tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
