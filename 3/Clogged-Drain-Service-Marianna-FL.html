<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan, a rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner kit and the water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself.
