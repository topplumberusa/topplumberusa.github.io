As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>

<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend far more. With this approach, you know the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
