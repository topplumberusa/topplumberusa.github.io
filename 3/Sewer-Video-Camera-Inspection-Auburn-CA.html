<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if essential, to place the tube back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop if the old discharge tube is too short.

Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the makers flow diagram is essential to ensure it was fixed appropriately. An effectively fixed assembly must offer years of security.</p>
