<p>The pipe-bursting approach is utilized on pipes that are severely harmed, for changing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes two 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe.
