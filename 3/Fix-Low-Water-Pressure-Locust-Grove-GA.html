<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other areas of your home. A sewage smell emanating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be an indicator of a major problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your house may have burst or otherwise broken. It is essential that you get in touch with a certified plumber if there is a consistent sewage smell in your home. Raw sewage is extremely harmful and can posture major health dangers.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are significantly harmed, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes two four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.

<p>In the meantime, nevertheless, we suggest you first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while.
