While water overuse is an issue for your wallet, it's also a problem for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regeneration procedure. That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above approaches do not work, the next action would be to eliminate the P-trap under the sink. Place a pail underneath the area to capture water then loosen the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place. Nowadays, a lot of kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
