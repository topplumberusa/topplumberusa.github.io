<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to blockages with food and grease being the major offenders. If fats are put down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls also. Even tree roots can develop serious drain blockages by wrapping around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, forcing plumbers to find and repair the issue for normal house plumbing operations. If this is what is happening to your home, you need your drain cleaned before it results in further damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
