<p>Gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our houses, for lightening our stoves, and for running devices such as water heaters.

As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. Nevertheless, to thwart off that threat, mercaptans are included into natural gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking.
