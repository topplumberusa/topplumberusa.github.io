<p>Each part of the assembly should be tested to identify what needs repair. The field test might not constantly reveal you the seriousness of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the fundamental rubber repair package are required.

<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, ensure the brand-new waste disposal unit installation set includes a tube, or purchase one individually at the very same time for about $3.</p>
