<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the offender. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely. A chain with too little slack can cause difficulty too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>Like any household home appliance, water heaters need routine maintenance to operate securely and efficiently. Regular water heater maintenance can also extend the life of the home appliance and help avoid unexpected leakages or other problems.

Seek advice from your local Roto-Rooter plumber to establish a water heater maintenance schedule that will optimize the life of your device.</p>
<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a practical solution, specifically when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they usually contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and household.</p>
