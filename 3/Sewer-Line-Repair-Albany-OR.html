Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's changed effectively (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not have to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first shot using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the suitable preventative measures.</p>
