Repiping is the procedure of changing old corroded pipes with resilient and lasting brand-new pipes. The new pipes that are utilized are normally made of copper because of their durability and other factors. Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and made out of galvanized metals.</p>
