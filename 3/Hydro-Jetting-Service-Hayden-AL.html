<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Hayden AL</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had terrific reviews and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>If the leaking hot water heater is inside of the house, it is nest to immediately run the water off to the heater and schedule a consultation with a plumber to avoid flooding inside of the house.
