<p>Aside from these 2 important elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less critical things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to capture sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
