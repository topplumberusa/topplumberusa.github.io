This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>
