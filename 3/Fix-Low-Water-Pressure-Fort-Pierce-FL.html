How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced immediately. Before you can request an inspection, you should initially acquire the needed license( s) for the work you intend to do.

<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can occur in time from the accumulation of hair, littles soap and fibers from towels that builds up within pipes. As a clog becomes larger over time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining appropriately.

<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first shot using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner.
