Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
