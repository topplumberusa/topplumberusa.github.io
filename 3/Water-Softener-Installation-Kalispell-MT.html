<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with recognized backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, pool, and jacuzzis. Turn the disposal system to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then link it. Relying on the existing trap configuration, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>Gently lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's changed effectively (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
