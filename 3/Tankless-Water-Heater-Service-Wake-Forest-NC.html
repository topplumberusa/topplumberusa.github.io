Many of us fall under a regimen of preparing our lives around hot water without even realizing it.

<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Tankless Hot water heater - supply warm water as needed without a tank. The activation of a faucet requiring warm water activates the heater and water is heated as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Since they can impede the blades, cooking oil and other greases must never ever be put down the garbage disposal. Last but not least, cold water must be running when the garbage disposal is on and need to continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is switched off to ensure that all food particles have actually been rinsed through the pipes.</p>
