This is due largely to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to customer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening just gets rid of hardness minerals and removes problems that are a problem and not a threat to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual preference not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and drawbacks, that make this decision a considerable one.</p>

<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a viable service, particularly when basic plunging does not seem to work. However, there are many downsides to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>
