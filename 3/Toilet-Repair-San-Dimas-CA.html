The city or Uruk includes the oldest recognized examples of brick built Latrines, built atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had changeable and quickly removable sectors, and enabled cleaning.</p>
<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement fixtures, a structure permit is usually required before a plumbing permit can be issued. Soften only what you need to. People frequently pick to soften showers, sinks, and laundry connections. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps typically do not need to be linked to a softener. In many cases, people pick to soften just the warm water.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
