Which is why picking a comfy, reliable toilet seat is very important. However, you have to make sure your toilet seat actually fits your toilet. Most of toilets are standard sized - suggesting a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have distinctively shaped bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol.
