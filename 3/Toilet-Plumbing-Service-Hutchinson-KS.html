<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
