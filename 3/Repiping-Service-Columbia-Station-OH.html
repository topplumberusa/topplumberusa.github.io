The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
