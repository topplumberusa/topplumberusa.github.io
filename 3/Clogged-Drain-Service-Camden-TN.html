<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
