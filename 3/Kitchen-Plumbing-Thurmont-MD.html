For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom.
