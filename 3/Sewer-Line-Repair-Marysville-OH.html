The secret to the innovation is having the ability to manage both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thereby eliminating solidity ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
