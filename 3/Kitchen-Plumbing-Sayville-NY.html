<p>Drain cleanouts provide an entry point into your house's drainage system so blockages can be removed. They are typically white pipes located outside your house but can be other colors. Cleanouts allow simple access into your drain system so when you have a problem a service technician can get the rooter machine into the line to clear the clog or camera the line.</p>

<h3>Necessity of Sewer Line Inspection in Sayville NY 11782 and Its Procedures</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>You most likely have a main sewer line clog if you find standing water in your cleanout or water that is overflowing out of your cleanout.
