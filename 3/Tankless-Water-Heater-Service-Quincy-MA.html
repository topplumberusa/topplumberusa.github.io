Try freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>Water might be dripping onto the pilot burner flame. A leaking tank is a factor to call a water heater specialist right away.

<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets need to definitely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
