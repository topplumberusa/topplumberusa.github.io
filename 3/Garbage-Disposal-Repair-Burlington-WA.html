<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
