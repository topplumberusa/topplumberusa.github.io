<p>The electric water heater is one of the most popular designs selected by customers. Before deciding to get an electrical heater, it is necessary that you are familiar with more about this particular design and the advantages it has to offer.

<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair service technician understands the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
