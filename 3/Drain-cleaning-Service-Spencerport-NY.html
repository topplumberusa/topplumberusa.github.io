Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. A number of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the appropriate precautions.</p>
