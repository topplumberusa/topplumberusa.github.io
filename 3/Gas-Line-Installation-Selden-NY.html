<p>If you find yourself constantly jerking the flush lever to try to stop your toilet from running, it's time to hire among our licensed Columbus plumbers to help you in discovering the leak or broken element and repairing it. Grease: Never put grease, fats, or oils down your kitchen sink. Rather than removing, these products typically cake to form nasty clogs, which you may need a plumber to eliminate.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made of aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can bring in the irons that would typically cause rust. After extended usage, these rods will ultimately become broken and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you could experience major problems with your water heater extremely quickly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>If you discover low water pressure or blemished water, it generally represents rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals build up in time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you may see lower water pressure. The discoloration happens when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and circulation into your water system, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health hazard in your water.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an undesirable circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it risky to consume.</p>
