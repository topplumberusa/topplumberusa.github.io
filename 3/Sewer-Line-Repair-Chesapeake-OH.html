<p>Water temperature level problems can be repaired by adjusting the temperature level on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be triggered by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can just loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>
<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement components, a building permit is normally required before a plumbing authorization can be provided. Soften only what you need to. Individuals typically choose to soften showers, sinks, and laundry hookups. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps normally do not need to be linked to a softener. In many cases, individuals pick to soften just the hot water.</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing Permit and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause water pipes to lose pressure. When that happens, water is no longer pushed forward into the residential or commercial property, allowing it to flow backward into city water products.</p>
