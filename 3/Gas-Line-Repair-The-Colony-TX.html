<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
