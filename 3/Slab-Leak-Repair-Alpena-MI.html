Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always stream towards the point of least expensive pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to assist fight a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The demand upstream might trigger a reversal in circulation.</p>
<p>Handheld sprayer. Leaks can sometimes develop on the water lines for handheld sprayers that are attached to the kitchen sink. Water will drip into the cabinet below if the leak is far enough down the water line.
