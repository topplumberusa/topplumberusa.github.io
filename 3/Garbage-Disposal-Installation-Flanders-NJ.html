<p>Once the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
