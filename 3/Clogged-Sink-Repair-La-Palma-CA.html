<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will establish. Often the service is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is required to fix the concern. Other times a more extensive service is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>Do not put everything down your garbage disposal. It is very important to watch what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and possibly trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can likewise cause jams and obstructions - think about composting or placing these products in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can collect and congeal in your drain also. After finishing cooking, consider putting remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to reserve. You can then reheat and use for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
