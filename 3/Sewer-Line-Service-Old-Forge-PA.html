<h3>How to Remove a Sink Drain Pop Up in Old Forge PA 18518</h3>
<p>When drains are clogged, it is not constantly due to blockages that stem inside the house. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also called tree root invasion. When tree roots start to make their way inside somebody's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes already installed, such as cast iron, plastic, copper or clay, will determine the level of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can take place over time from the buildup of hair, littles soap and fibers from towels that collects inside of pipes.
