<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on.
