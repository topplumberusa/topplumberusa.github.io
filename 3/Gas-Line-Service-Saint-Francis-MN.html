<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades.

This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
