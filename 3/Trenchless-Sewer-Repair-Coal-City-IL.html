Which is why choosing a comfortable, reliable toilet seat is very important. However, you need to make certain your toilet seat really fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are standard sized - implying a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and comfort. Some toilets, however, have uniquely shaped bowls and need a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It actually isn't a great concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to little, unless they have been particularly developed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or will not distribute your weight uniformly and could ultimately cause fractures in the bowl.</p>
