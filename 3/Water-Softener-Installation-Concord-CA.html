<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to discover the cause of routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>Don't put everything down your waste disposal unit. It is essential to watch what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can likewise cause jams and blockages - think about composting or placing these products in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can collect and cake in your drain as well. After finishing cooking, consider putting remaining grease or oil into a container or bowl to reserve. You can then reheat and use for other cooking or quickly location in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>

<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not really the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
