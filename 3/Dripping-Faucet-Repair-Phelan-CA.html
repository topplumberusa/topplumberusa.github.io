<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Phelan CA</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
