<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the perpetrator. However not constantly. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can cause difficulty too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack ideal.</p>
