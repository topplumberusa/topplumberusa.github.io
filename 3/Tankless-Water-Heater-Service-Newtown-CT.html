<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>

It can also indicate the hot water heater is near completion of its life if it is more than 6 or 7 years old.
