Hardness removal is not a necessity to protect your health, however water softening is popular due to the fact that many people prefer softened water for bathing, cleaning and washing.</p>
<p>This is incredibly important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system.
