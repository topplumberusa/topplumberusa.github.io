<p>Check the home's warm water heater You will be wanting to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a family of four need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age.

Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated and readily available for use. Likewise, deterioration of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a short life. If the water heater is old or you see obvious signs of corrosion, request that a brand-new one be installed.</p>
