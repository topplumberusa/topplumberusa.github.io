It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

Here we take a look at some of the characteristics of the significant pipe types to help you choose the right pipe for your plumbing.</p>
