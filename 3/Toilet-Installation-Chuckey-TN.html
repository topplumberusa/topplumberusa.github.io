<p>While fighting a fire, firemens are not surprisingly more concerned about drawing adequate water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not just will they utilize water from any readily available source to attain their goal, but fire department automobiles frequently carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, corrosion inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>

If that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the issue might spread out exponentially. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in specific residences, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from receding out and contaminating the general public water system.</p>
