<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a need more than a need. When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on really gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are developed to supply years of protection. There are lots of regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water turbidity, quality or temperature level can all trigger the assembly to deteriorate in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies might rarely need repair while some are repaired regularly. The test information from the field test will figure out the repair frequency.</p>
