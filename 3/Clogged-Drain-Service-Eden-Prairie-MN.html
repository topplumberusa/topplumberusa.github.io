<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Eden Prairie MN</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it as well.</p>
