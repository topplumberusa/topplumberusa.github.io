However, there are many drawbacks to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
