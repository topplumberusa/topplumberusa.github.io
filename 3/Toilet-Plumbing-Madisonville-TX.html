<p>Agilent's range of leak detection solutions make sure the security, security and consistent efficiency of research study, vacuum, and industrial process systems. Inspecting the water meter is a fantastic next action in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and check. There is a leak someplace and this might be serious issue if it is. Carry on to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in the house must have water. This opts for every other turned off valve and their matching faucets. If whatever is working properly, you are off to a great start.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are 2 other types of backflow preventers available that you may run into. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a dual check". It is NOT the same thing as a Check although it may be marketed as one! Don't get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses comparable to Check (5 PSI).</p>
