<p>Clark's Process: This process is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which triggers the solidity ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 must be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back. When it pertains to pipe repair, the most costly factors aren't the machinery or products utilized, however the uprooting, lawn and landscaping damage that takes place.</p>

The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
