Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
