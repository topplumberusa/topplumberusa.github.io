<p>The source or place of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (generally 10 feet broad) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
