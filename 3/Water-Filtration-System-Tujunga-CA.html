<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each part. If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide might limit the movement (instead of steady or direct) of the part, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
