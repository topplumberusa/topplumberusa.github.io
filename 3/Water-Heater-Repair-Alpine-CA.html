<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the service with hardness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to confess water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is without hardness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>Since of the intrinsic design of a lowered pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an incredibly low circulation or static flow condition may trigger nuisance dripping and potential fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure consistent to the assembly in times of fluctuating supply pressure.</p>
