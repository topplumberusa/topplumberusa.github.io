<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc created and constructed a smaller design that operated on the very same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was ceased in 1973.</p>
