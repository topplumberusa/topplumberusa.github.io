<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
