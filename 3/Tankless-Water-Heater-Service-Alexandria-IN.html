<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently lift the rod and listen. If the water shuts off, you might be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no change screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's changed effectively (Photo 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
