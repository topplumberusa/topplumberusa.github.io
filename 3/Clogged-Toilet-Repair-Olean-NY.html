By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to provide some type of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're working on installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to build one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to maintain the unit.</p>
