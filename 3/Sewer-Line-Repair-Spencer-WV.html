<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective working a requirement more than a need. When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be checked to guarantee no valves were mistakenly exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
