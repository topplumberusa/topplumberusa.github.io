<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide.

If the part is not repaired properly, the guide might limit the motion (rather than constant or direct) of the element, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities.
