First, prepare for each device to be installed should be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which may take up to 3 weeks or more to authorize and process.

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the building; additional, more substantial expenses can happen if the drop in water pressure ends up being a concern for locals. A PE or RA can help determine if setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>

Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were integrated in the '70s and constructed of galvanized metals.</p>
