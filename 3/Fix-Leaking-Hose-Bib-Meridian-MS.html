<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
