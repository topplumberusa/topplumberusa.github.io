<p>Irreversible magnetic water conditioning devices have been marketed based on a variety of claims regarding their result on water solidity and associated scale formation. The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment market, has not had the ability to determine standards for these items and report irregular performance to date. Research has shown no change takes place in the physical and chemical properties or the calcium ion concentration of water treated with the gadgets (The Water Quality Association Magnetics Job Force, 2001).</p>
<p>Some producers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
