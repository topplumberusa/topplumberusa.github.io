<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>Letters are sent to residential customers with known backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, pool, and hot tubs. Rotate the disposal system to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then connect it. Depending upon the existing trap setup, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
