<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there must be no problem in getting most of the waste through.

Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are finished cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
