<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great person. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as assured. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Replacing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complex than replacing with a various design. So, if you are not looking specifically for a various disposal this might be something to consider. A totally different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink port has to be puttied into location. A safe and secure seal is a must. As soon as linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, taking care to link wires accurately, and the base covered to protect the circuitry from any water getting in.</p>

We will identify the problem and clear the line before a backup causes pricey damage to your home or business. Day after day, every year that sediment will continue to develop causing problems down road. By setting up new repiping your house you will fix this problem and enjoy better water pressure.</p>
