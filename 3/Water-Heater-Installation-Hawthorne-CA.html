<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this technique, you know the turnkey rate entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
