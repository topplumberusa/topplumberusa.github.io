<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Promises? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
<p>Your storm drains do not go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is generally directed elsewhere to a neighboring treatment plant, a creek, and even the ocean in.
