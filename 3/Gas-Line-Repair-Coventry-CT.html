<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the drinkable system offering the cosmetics water, backpressure is created. This can require the drinkable water to reverse its instructions of circulation through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Potential contaminants can then get in the drinkable water supply. The very best way to minimize accumulation is have a professional flush it at least when a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is specifically tough with high mineral content, you might need to flush the hot water heater more often.</p>
<p>Once installed, these BPAs go through periodic and preliminary testing and maintenance requirements to validate their continued operational efficiency.

<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal proof that particular magnetic and electro-magnetic devices can be effective in preventing scale formation in difficult water systems. It is very challenging to judge such claims, which are nearly never ever based upon tests that are well enough explained to permit others to assess them and to verify the results. While the lack of "clinical" proof does not in itself revoke a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it should make one hesitate to accept it without some guarantee of efficiency.</p>
