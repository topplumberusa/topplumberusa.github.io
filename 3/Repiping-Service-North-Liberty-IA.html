It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close appropriately.

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
