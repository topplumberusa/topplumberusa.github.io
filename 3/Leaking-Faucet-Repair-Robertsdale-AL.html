<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other areas of your house. A sewage odor emanating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be an indicator of a major issue with your plumbing.

<p>The source or place of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (generally 10 feet broad) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Prior to our professional service technicians can begin using their abilities and experience, we initially need to ensure that the line is effectively cleaned up and gotten ready for our repair work. Our repair processes depend on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws triggered by waste buildup can prevent the liner from adhering to the walls appropriately. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for an extensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line.
