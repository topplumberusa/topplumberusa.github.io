<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a practical solution, specifically when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous downsides to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>
