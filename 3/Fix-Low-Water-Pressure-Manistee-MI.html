Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals.

When tree roots begin to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The kind of drain pipes currently installed, such as cast iron, plastic, clay or copper, will identify the level of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
