Blanc likewise built a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and community sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
