<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust. This corrosion can cause a buildup of lead, which can have many unfavorable impacts on your health. Corroded pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. Since they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally restore after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>
