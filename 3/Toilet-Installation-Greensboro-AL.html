<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Assures? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>

<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low.
