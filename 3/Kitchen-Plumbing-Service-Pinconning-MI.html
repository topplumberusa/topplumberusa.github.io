<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
