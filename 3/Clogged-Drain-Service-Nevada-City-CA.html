<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to discover the cause of routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification.

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position.
