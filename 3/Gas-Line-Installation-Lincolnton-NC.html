You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
