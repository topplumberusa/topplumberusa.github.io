<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Services in Novato</h2>

<p>Sewer lines have one important role: carry wastewater out of a house or structure. Many folks replace their water heaters due to poor efficiency, total failure or as a preventive measure. If your water heater is more than ten years old, it's time to consider replacing it with a more effective design. Water on the floor can mean worn parts. Your plumber might replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole. Compared to the daily expenditures and disappointments incurred by hard water, a water softener is ultimately an investment that will save you a substantial amount of money. The cost of the water softener system is greatly exceeded by the cash and energy saved.</p>

<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
