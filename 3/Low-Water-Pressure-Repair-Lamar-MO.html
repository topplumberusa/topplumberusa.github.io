<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
