<p>Check Valves and Double Checks. There are 2 other kinds of backflow preventers readily available that you might encounter. The very first is a check valve. The second is a dual check".

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Bennington VT</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building requires a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in exceptionally rare cases where the building is considered to not present a threat to the water supply, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
