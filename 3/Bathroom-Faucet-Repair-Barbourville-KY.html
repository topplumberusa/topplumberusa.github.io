<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical new one is less complex than changing with a various design. So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this might be something to think about. A totally various disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink connector has to be puttied into location. A protected seal is a must. Once linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is attached.
