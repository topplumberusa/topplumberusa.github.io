<p>Backpressure may happen when the safe and clean supply piping is connected to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not correctly protected, non-potable and potable water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical substance that functions as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water rather than developing on surface areas.
