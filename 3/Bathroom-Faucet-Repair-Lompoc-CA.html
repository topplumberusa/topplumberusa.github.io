<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of little, maybe less vital things that can break or deteriorate. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
