<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

Using these products is called chemigation. There are numerous elements to this valve. The check valve has a spring ran flapper, which allows circulation in just one instructions. There is also a low pressure drain and an air vacuum release valve in the device. The last part is the injection port. This is where the chemicals are presented to go downstream of the check valve.</p>
