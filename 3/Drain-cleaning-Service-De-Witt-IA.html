<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the very first most obvious signs of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy issue such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent severe damage to your home. Even if the issue comes from with the community system, it's still wise to bring in the experts to restrict the damage to your home.</p>
<p>Whether a water supply is labelled "soft" or "hard" depends on the existence of two extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health standpoint, these minerals have no unfavorable results and are, in reality, necessary daily nutrients. It is minerals that provide water the revitalizing flavor many people discover desirable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, potentially plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and reduce the efficiency of cleaning agents and soaps. At this moment the water is stated to be difficult.</p>
