<p>Another typical misperception is that calcium-carbonate scale is a reliable type of deterioration control. There is a lack of clinical proof supporting this claim, nevertheless.

<p>Whether a water supply is labelled "soft" or "hard" depends on the presence of two extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium.
