<p>Pipeline video inspection is a type of telepresence used to visually examine the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A typical application is for a plumber to determine the condition of small diameter sewer lines and household connection drain pipes.

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be attached to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws initially planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can result in improper drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>If you presume your toilet has a leak, the good news is that it does not necessarily require a repair of your whole unit. A toilet's tank is composed of several little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or repaired due to their frequent use. When these parts break, they lead to tiny leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as quickly as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures unusable. Whether you have a sink that does not drain appropriately or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help.

Sometimes, a handyman might determine that a replacement part is required (like a pvc, tailpiece, or reducer  trap) to make sure typical operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman representative today to go over repair alternatives.</p>
