<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the public water system and private on-site water system and distribution systems by forbiding cross-connections between potable (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of main and secondary backflow prevention methods. Secondary backflow techniques supply an increased level of protection for the general public water supply system.</p>
<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you do not get that opportunity.

A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and make complex the job with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and claims. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the best.</p>
