<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a necessity more than a need. When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on really gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to guarantee no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
