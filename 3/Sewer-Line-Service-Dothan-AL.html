<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest organic products, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work much better than products consisting of severe chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the most part, a garbage disposal is just equipped to handle softer natural waste. It could trigger it to jam and not work properly if bones or other hard foods get stuck in the disposal. By running warm water through the disposal, you might be able to clear the clog yourself. However you run the risk of damaging the motor or blades.</p>
