<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this large quantity of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without hindering water flow. By setting up a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by saving the amount of trash that gets sent to land fills and other disposing locations. With a garbage disposal the garbage is handled through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
