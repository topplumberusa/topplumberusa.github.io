<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Carrollton GA 30117</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
