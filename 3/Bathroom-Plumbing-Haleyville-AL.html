<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and pricey plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and area of the pipe, it was a tough job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
