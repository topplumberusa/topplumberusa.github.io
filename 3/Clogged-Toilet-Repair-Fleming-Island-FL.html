If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet must be changed. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural stability of the home.</p>

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and then return to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, normally regenerate after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
