<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. Since they restore whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually restore after numerous gallons of water have been softened. Such models are hassle-free if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
