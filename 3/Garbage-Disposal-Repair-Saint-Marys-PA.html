When you hot water heater is not working correctly, it might be since of any variety of repair or maintenance issues. In many cases it is a simple fix and does not need a new warm water heater.

<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are seriously damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for repairing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes 2 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new seamless pipe behind it.
