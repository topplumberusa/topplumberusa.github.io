When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes.

<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Gladewater TX</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
