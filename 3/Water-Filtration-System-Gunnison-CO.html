<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then return to service. Because they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, normally regrow after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
