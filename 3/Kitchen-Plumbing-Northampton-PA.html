While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
