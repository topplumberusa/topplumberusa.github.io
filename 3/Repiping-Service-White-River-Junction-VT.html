<p>Likewise called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal comes in 2 basic types - continuous feed, which usually has a wall-mounted switch so the system keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover remain in place to run the unit. Continuous feed is common and the most convenient to use; a batch feed model is much safer but can be slower to use on large amounts of food waste due to the fact that you have to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company provides a summary of garbage disposal types and styles.</p>
