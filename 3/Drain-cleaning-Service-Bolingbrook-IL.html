<p>After the pipe is cleaned, we transfer to utilize our repairs as rapidly and efficiently as possible. Our equipment is trenchless-based, and the liner we insert into the sewer line is able to inflate in order to apply the epoxy resin. The resin is given a few hours to fully solidify and cure, and after the sewer pipe line repair process is ended up, our consumers are provided with a brand-new sewer line that will contribute to the general quality of the sewer system for many years.
