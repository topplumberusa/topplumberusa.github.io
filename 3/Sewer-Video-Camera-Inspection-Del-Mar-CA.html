<p>Backpressure may happen when the safe and clean supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Safe and clean and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system if these connections are not correctly secured.</p>
<p>When a natural gas line is ruptured, it right away ends up being a severe safety threat. Without being repaired as quickly as possible, it might trigger a fair bit of damage if the gas inside becomes ignited.
