The activation of a faucet needing warm water triggers the heater and water is heated as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Due to the fact that they can hinder the blades, cooking oil and other greases need to never be put down the garbage disposal.

<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to obstructions with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. They harden to the piping walls if fats are poured down the sink.

If this is what is taking place to your house, you need your drain cleaned before it results in additional damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
