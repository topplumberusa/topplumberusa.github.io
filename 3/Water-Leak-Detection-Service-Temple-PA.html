So, if you are not looking specifically for a various disposal this might be something to consider. A completely various disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink connector needs to be puttied into location. A safe and secure seal is a must. Once linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is attached. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to connect wires properly, and the base covered to secure the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
