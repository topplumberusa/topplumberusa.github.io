The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main drains pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>A number of companies, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) offer certification courses created to train experts to test backflow preventers.
