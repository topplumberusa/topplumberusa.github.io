<p>Central Ohio Gas Line Services LLC focuses on the installation and repair of commercial and residential natural gas and lp gas lines, water service lines, gas line troubleshooting and assessment services. If your commercial residential or commercial property already has a backflow preventer, you're responsible for having it tested every year by a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List We will inform you by mail when it's time for your backflow test.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
