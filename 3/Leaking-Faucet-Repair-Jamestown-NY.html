I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>

<p>Plumbing is a vital part of your house or service, and its ability to function is essential.

<p>Aside from these two essential components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less vital things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain.

If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed.

We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
