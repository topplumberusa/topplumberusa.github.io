<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
