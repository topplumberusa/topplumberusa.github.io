When you remain in a safe location, call the Peoples emergency hotline.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation. I've checked with a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the price to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
