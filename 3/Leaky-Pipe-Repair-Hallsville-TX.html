<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the safe and clean system providing the make-up water, backpressure is created. This can force the drinkable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the two systems. Potential impurities can then get in the safe and clean water system. The best method to lower build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of as soon as a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is specifically tough with high mineral material, you might need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>

They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
