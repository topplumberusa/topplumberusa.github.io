<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to spot.</p>
