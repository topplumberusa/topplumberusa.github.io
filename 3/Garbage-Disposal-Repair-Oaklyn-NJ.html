<p>A garbage disposal must not leak. When this takes place, it usually shows wear and tear which is a reasonable indication that its time is up. Leaks can be unclean and will also ultimately trigger stress on other parts of your garbage disposal if you think about what you put down the disposal. The kitchen sink drain may need a simple tightening or a replacement. If the leak remains in the pressurized hose spray, you will see the apparent spray. For a leak in the drain pipe, you may need to fill the sink with water prior to analyzing the pipe underneath.</p>
