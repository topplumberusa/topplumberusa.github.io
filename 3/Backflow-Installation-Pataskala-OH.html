<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair split pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Daily use must not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from happening, install the unit in a stable and safe place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth, you must wait until after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings. You should also inspect to make certain your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
