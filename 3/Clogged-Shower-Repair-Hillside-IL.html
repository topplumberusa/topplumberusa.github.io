Typically handles are toilet parts that get corroded or loose and no longer pull the flap up or drop it pull back effectively. It's a simple repair, but there's a technique to getting the flush deal with out. The retaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you remain in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen (Image 1). Then eliminate the old handle and lever, slide the brand-new deal with into location, and thread on the maintaining nut. Tighten by relying on the right (Picture 2).</p>
