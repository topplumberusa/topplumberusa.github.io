<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly.

<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your lawn. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will ultimately take its toll. If you notice that your plumbing experiences numerous clogs, leaks, and water pressure change that no amount of repairs seems to stem, you must speak with a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as a service. House owners must examine water pressure entering into their house on a routine basis. Water pressure must be about 55 to 60 PSI; some city water pressure can can be found in at over 100 PSI.</p>
