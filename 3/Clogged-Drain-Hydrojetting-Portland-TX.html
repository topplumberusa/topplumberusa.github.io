<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to discover.</p>

PEX also withstands corrosion and freezing much better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will choose which product is best depending on your requirements.</p>
