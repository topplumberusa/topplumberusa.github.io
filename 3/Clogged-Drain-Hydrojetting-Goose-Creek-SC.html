<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required.

The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
