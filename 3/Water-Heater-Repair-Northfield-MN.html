<p>Your storm drains do not go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is usually directed elsewhere to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, or even the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat sections of pipe that can be prone to clogging because there simply isn't enough a high sufficient circulation to flush out the debris.</p>
