Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the kind of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
