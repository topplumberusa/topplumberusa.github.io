<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This corrosion can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have numerous negative effects on your health. Rusty pipes likewise lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries impurities back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
