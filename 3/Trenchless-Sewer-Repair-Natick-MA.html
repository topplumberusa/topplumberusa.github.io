<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of flow in a potable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always stream towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The need upstream might cause a turnaround in circulation.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal lasts approximately 10 to 12 years. This typical lifespan computation assumes typical wear and tear of the unit.
