<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and detailed plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair.
