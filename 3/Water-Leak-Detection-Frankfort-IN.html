<p>If you believe your toilet has a leak, the good news is that it doesn't always need a repair of your whole system. A toilet's tank is made up of numerous little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their regular use. When these parts break, they result in small leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as quickly as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
