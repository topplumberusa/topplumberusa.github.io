Water pressure might be or fail minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened).

<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
