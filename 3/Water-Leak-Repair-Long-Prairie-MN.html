<p>Repiping is a plumbing procedure that changes your current pipes with new ones.

No matter what the source of the problem is, our experts can handle your pipe replacements with expertise and ability. Read on to learn more about our repiping discount rates, in addition to the top signs you might notice if your house or organisation is due for a pipe replacement.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain will not fix the problem. You may need to check out using a high pressure water supply to remove the clog. This procedure is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the intensity of the clog. There are two standard piping products utilized by plumbing experts. PEX and copper both provide various advantages and benefits such as eliminating the metal taste from your water.</p>
