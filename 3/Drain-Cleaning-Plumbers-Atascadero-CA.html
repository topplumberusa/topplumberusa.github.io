<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may require extra adapters, versatile tubing is far much easier to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting is an issue. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I face situations, on a regular basis that need a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job. Often, the basements are so filled with sewage, I can not securely get in the basement and operate up until the sewage is extracted and the basement is generally cleaned up. I 'd like to post some pictures of this. Simply look on line. The problem does exist.</p>
