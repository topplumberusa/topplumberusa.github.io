<p>The source or area of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>A leak in a single pipe can quickly be fixed by replacing that area of damaged piping. However, when the problem is discovered in pipes throughout your home, it might be time to consider whole-house repiping. Couple of homeowners are delighted with the concept of changing all their pipes, but dealing with the job before the plumbing system fails permits you to prevent significant residential or commercial property damage.</p>
