It's so old that it is no longer able to press water through the toilet to completely clear the drain. This results in your toilet having a consistent blocking problem.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to present a chemical substance that functions as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water rather than building up on surfaces. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the accumulation could still take place.</p>
<p>The average toilet will last for years and have minimal problems that can be easily repaired without replacement. Nevertheless, when it is time for toilet replacement, it is important to have a knowledgeable and licensed  plumber handle the task. At Morrison Plumbing, Heating and Air, we have more than 30 years of experience with toilet installation and toilet replacement. Whether you need a brand-new toilet for a bathroom remodel, moving into a new house, or simply wanting to upgrade your existing toilet, we ensure that our installation procedure will not harm your house or its plumbing system.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above approaches do not work, the next step would be to remove the P-trap under the sink. Place a container below the area to capture water then unscrew the two threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in place. Nowadays, many kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
