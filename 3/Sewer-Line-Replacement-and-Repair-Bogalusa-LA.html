<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less important things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed.
