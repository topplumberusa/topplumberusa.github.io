<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not really the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>

<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Maryville MO</h3>
<p>Old, worn, or damaged plumbing pipes can trigger substantial problems. Even little leakages can slowly moisten walls and floors till they end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other allergens.

Chances are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger might not suffice to resolve this problem. Call a plumber immediately.</p>
