<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
