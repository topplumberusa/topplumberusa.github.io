As a safety precaution, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that provides gas a smell frequently related to rotten eggs. This distinct aroma allows you to smell a prospective leak if it happens. Always leave if you think a leak.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
