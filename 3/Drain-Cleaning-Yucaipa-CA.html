<p>Do not put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It's important to view what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and potentially cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also cause jams and blockages - think about composting or putting these items in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can harden and gather in your drain also.

Tough water interferes with the lathering of soaps and shampoos, causing you to use more. Difficult water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
