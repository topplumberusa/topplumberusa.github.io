<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy, a rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a new burner set and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself.

The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
