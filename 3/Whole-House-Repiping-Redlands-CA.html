<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not truly the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>

Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow.
