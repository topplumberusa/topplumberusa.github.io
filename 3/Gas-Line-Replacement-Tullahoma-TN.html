<p>Your sewer line is among the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being broken or clogged, it could wreak unwelcome concerns on your property. .

<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair service technician understands the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
