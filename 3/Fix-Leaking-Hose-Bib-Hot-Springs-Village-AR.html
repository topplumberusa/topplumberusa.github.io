It is necessary that the repair service technician understands the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation.
