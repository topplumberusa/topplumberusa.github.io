<p>You count on your drains to carry wastewater from your shower, sink or tub. With time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These materials collect in the drain and ultimately harden versus the pipe walls, making them hard to eliminate. Your hot water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leakages are one of the most common indications that your system is at the end of its life-span, especially if they are triggering significant flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
<p>In fact, that's how difficult water" got its name, from the hardened mineral deposits this sort of water leaves.
