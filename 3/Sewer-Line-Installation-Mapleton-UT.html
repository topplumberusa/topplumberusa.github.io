<p>Central Ohio Gas Line Services LLC concentrates on the installation and repair of residential and commercial gas and lp gas lines, water service lines, gas line troubleshooting and consultation services. If your commercial property already has a backflow preventer, you are accountable for having it evaluated every year by a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List We will notify you by mail when it's time for your backflow test.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
