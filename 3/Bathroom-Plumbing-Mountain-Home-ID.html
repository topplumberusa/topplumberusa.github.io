<p>Toilet flush manages are another part of a toilet that can cause toilets to keep running. Often handles are toilet parts that get loose or rusty and no longer pull the flap up or drop it back down correctly. It's a simple repair, but there's a technique to getting the flush manage out. The keeping nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you remain in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen (Photo 1). Then eliminate the old manage and lever, slide the new manage into place, and thread on the keeping nut. Tighten by relying on the right (Image 2).</p>
