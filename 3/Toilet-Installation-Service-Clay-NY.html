<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future.
