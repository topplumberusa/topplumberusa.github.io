Well, we still recommend you have a backflow preventer set up anywhere inbound water and wastewater might be cross-connected.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
