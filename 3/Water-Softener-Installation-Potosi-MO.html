<p>Whether a water supply is identified "soft" or "tough" depends on the presence of 2 extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no unfavorable effects and are, in reality, vital day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the rejuvenating taste many people find desirable. However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, possibly plug pipes and damage water heaters, and reduce the effectiveness of soaps and detergents. At this point the water is said to be hard.</p>
