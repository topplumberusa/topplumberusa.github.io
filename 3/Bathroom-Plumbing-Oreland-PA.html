<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your yard. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
