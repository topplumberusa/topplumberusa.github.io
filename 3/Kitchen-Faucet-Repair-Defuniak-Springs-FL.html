<p>Some producers declare that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
