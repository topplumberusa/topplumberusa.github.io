<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are seriously damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes two 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be resistant to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
<p>Broken pipes end up being very more costly to fix as the rate of the circulation of the broken pipe grows.
