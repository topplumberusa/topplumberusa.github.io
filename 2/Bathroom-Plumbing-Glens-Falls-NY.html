<p>Aside from these 2 crucial elements, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less critical things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
