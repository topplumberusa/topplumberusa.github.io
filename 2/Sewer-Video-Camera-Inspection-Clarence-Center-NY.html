Inspecting the water meter is an excellent next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and examine if the water meter is turning. There is a leak somewhere and this might be severe problem if it is. Move on to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in your house should have water.

<h3>Drain Repair in Clarence Center New York</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
