<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
