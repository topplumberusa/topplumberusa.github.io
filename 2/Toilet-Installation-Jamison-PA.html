<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific person. He informed me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as assured. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently lift the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted effectively (Picture 8). You do not have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
