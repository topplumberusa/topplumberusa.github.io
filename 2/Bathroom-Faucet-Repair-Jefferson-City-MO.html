<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>When set up, these BPAs are subject to regular and preliminary testing and maintenance requirements to verify their continued functional effectiveness. Such testing must be performed by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific info is also available online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Information ).</p>
<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or overload gas.

As helpful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. However, to thwart off that danger, mercaptans are added into gas, which gives it a rotten egg smell and makes it noticeable when leaking.
