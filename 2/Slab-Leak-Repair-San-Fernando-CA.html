<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a little pinhole leak will develop. Sometimes the solution is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is necessary to fix the concern. Other times a more comprehensive solution is required: repiping.</p>
