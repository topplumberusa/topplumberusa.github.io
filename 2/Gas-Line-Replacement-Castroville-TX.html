<p>When sewer line breaks, it typically causes the yard above it to end up being soaked. You may smell the disgusting smell of sewage before you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (ideally shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it necessary to cordon off that part of your lawn. Since the swampiness will attract unwanted creatures, the scenario is laden with problems. Plumbers describe a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's phone number is on your speed dial.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any short-term or irreversible connection in between a public water system or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds.

<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
