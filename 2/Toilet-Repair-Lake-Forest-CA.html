<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this approach, you know the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>Though it's not constantly necessary, in some cases the plumber might have to repair or update electrical wiring to power the new garbage disposal. This generally costs an additional $50 to $100+. The pilot burner may need to be relit, the gas line might be clogged or need repair. The flowers or greenery near the gas leak will be stained or degraded if the gas line is harmed. Contact our specialists to determine the degree of the problem.</p>
