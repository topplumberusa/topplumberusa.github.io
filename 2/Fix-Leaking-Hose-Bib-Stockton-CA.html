<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a viable option, particularly when basic plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they usually contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>
