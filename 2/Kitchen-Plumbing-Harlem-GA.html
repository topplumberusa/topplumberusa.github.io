Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
