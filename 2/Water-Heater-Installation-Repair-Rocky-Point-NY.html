Camera are useful in finding buried septic systems or examining the condition of buried pipes to figure out appropriate maintenance schedules or the extent of necessary repairs. When the corrupt salesperson takes control of the camera, he might play a pre-taped inspection of a pipe in very bad condition and say it is your pipe.</p>

<p>You reside in an older home. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old. If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
