A hot water heater is basically a household home appliance that consists of a gas or electrical heating unit under a tank in which water is warmed and stored.

<p>Tankless Hot water heater - supply warm water as needed without a tank. The activation of a faucet requiring hot water activates the heater and water is heated as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Cooking oil and other greases should never ever be put down the garbage disposal since they can impede the blades. Last but not least, cold water needs to be running when the garbage disposal is on and must continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is turned off to guarantee that all food particles have actually been rinsed through the pipes.</p>

The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to enable the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and supply a cautious cleaning.</p>
