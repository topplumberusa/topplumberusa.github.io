<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Newport News VA</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it also.</p>

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a feasible solution, particularly when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many downsides to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>
