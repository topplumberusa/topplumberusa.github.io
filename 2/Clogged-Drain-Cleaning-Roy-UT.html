<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most common sink repair problems. Typical enough that lots of people choose do-it-yourself repairs. However sometimes even determining the leak can be a problem. It could be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, waste disposal unit fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>Keeping your trash dispoal clean isn't very hard or time consuming. Fill the sink a minimum of half full of soapy water. Get rid of the stopper from the drain while at the same time switching on the disposal. This will fill the entire disposal with soapy water and aid to flush out food buildup. It will also clean the blades and flush your pipes with clean water.</p>
