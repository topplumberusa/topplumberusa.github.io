<p>The sewer and drain systems of your house or service, is an important part of your life. While many people don't give them a second thought, your drains and sewer lines are almost continuously hard at work getting rid of your house or business's sewage.

<p>Some makers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>A drain professional will need to access the drain line from the roofing vents or take out a toilet. This is generally more labor-intensive and might require additional expenses.
