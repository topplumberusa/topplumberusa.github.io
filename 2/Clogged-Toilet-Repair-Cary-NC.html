It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be eliminated from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>
