<p>The most efficient method to resolve tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>With all of these elements and more, it's safe to state that running water is a need in any home. Due to the fact that the majority of the pipes in your house are hidden, it's nearly difficult to analyze the condition of your pipes and it is often challenging to identify a problem prior to it's far too late.
