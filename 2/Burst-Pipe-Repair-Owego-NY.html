<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
