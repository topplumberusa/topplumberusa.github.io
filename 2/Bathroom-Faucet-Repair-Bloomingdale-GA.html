<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
