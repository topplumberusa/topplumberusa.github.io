Our repair procedures rely on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws triggered by waste accumulation can avoid the liner from sticking to the walls correctly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits an extensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The unique nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to allow the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and provide a mindful cleaning.</p>
