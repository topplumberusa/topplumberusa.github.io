<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Contractors in Westfield</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
