<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a viable solution, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many downsides to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
