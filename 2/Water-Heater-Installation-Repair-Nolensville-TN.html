<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the step of hydrogen ion activity in a service and is used to express the intensity of the level of acidity of a service. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that launch hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up corrosion Carbon dioxide will possibly add to the formation of carbonic acid, thus making the water more destructive. The existence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to associate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
