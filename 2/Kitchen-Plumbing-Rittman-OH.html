<p>Stegle Plumbing has handled more than simply the residential work, finishing several recent commercial projects as well.A recent commercial plumbing project as a subcontractor was a 3,500-square-foot structure for a church. Consisted of in the task was an 800-square-foot commercial kitchen where Stegle's personnel set up a triple-compartment sink, a hand sink and commercial dishwasher. They also plumbed the ADA washrooms.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
