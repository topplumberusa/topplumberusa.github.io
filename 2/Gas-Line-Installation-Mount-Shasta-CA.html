<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
