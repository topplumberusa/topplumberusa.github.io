<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Sharon PA</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>If the leaking hot water heater is inside of the home, it is nest to right away run the water off to the heater and schedule an appointment with a plumber to prevent flooding inside of the home.
