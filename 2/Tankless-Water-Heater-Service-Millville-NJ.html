<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Millville NJ</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>

Regs. § 19-13-38a( c)( I)).</p>
