The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Often, it enters the house near the water heater. Your main turned off is connected to the end of the water main. Ensure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe gets in the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>This is extremely important! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to press the waste out of your drain system.
