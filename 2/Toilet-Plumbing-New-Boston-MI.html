<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
