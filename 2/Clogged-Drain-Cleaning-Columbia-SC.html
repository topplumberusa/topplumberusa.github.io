<p>You depend on your drains to carry wastewater from your shower, tub or sink. With time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products collect in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them challenging to get rid of.

<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and then go back to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt because they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, generally regenerate after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such models are practical.</p>
