If your commercial residential or commercial property currently has a backflow preventer, you are accountable for having it evaluated each year by a third-party Backflow Tester from our Approved Tester List We will inform you by mail when it's time for your backflow test.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
