<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
