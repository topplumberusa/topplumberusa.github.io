<p>However, there is one DIY project that isn't fundamental and is best left to the specialists: sewer line repair Sewer repairs can quickly end up being complex when dealt with by someone with little to no experience in plumbing.

<p>The average plumber's hourly wage is $68-$ 138. Sometimes simple repairs, such as unclogging a drain or a toilet, will have a repaired price of about $220 unless there are extenuating circumstances. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13.
