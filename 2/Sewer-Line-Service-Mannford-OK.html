<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.
