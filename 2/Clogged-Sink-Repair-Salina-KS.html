<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
