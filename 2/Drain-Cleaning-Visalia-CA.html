Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no other way to provide one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed.

<p>Making use of different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals.
