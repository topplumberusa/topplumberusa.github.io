<p>Colored water-- If your hot water seems rusty, this could be a sign that your hot water heater is rusting on the inside and may begin leaking soon. You can examine this by filling a couple of five-gallon pails with your water. Compare If your cold water is clear and your hot water is a brownish color, you most likely need a water heater replacement.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
