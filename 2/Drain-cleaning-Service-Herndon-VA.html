Copper is standard due to the fact that it's lasting, can make it through fires, and withstands weather. However, copper is hard to install, which means greater labor expenses.

PEX likewise resists corrosion and freezing much better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will choose which product is best depending on your requirements.</p>
