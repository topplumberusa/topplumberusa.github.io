<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
