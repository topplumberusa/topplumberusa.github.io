<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company provides include double check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel designs), and minimized pressure zone assemblies. Tip: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, remove the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet before installing the disposal. Also attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you attach the P-trap.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
