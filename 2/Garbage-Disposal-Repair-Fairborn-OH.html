<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
<p>There are two types of piping that are used in the repiping process. Due to the fact that of their cost, security and performance, copper piping and PEX piping are utilized. Copper piping prevents bacteria from growing inside of the pipe supplying healthy drinking water. PEX piping is made from a plastic product that is both light-weight and versatile. This product is resistant versus rust and will assist enhance water pressure.</p>
