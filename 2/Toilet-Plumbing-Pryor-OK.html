<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report need to be offered to the City of Bellingham.
