Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Domestic water that gets here to your Ohio home carries minerals that can cause rust on metal parts and components.
