<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
