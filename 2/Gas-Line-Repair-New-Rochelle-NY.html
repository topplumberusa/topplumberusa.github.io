<p>Gas leaks are frequently discovered at the gas valve, flare fitting, or at the gas union-a piece that enables connections and disconnections of gas appliances.

<p>Outdoor plumbing for obstructions or leaks. After inspecting whatever inside your home, your pro will then check the outdoor plumbing. He or she will make sure pipes have anti-freeze protection in place if you live an area where temperature levels go below freezing. More helpful homeowners might want to deal with garbage disposal problems on their own.

<p>Set up 50 gallon electric water heater and thermal expansion tank. When your drains are clogged, you will most likely start to notice gurgling sounds, water backing up into your sink or shower, or unusual smells. Drain obstructions are triggered by wear and tear or a build-up of things we put down the drain with time and as we understand, they can trigger serious plumbing problems.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
