<p>Carefully lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. Make sure it's adjusted properly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next step would be to eliminate the P-trap under the sink. Place a container below the area to catch water then unscrew the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place. Nowadays, the majority of kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
