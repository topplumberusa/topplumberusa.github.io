<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair service technician understands the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
