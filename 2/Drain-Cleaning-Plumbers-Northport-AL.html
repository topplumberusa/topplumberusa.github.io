<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Northport AL</h3>
<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
<p>If your sewer line is clogged or you believe it of being damaged, a digital camera inspection of the pipe is one of the very best tools for recognizing both the cause of the problem, and the place of the issue.
