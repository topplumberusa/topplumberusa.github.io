<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Louisa VA</h3>
<p>The most effective method to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
