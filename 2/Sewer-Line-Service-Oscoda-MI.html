<p>Very seldom does any structural damage take place as the result of slab leak. A slab leak is typically found before it causes any considerable damage. The water leak is normally the size of a pinhole. This small hole permits water to continually leak out extremely gradually. Gradually it can lead to a substantial develop of water. Dripped water generally remains under your home and fills into the ground soil. If the house's structure was not properly compressed, this can possibly cause a cavity.
