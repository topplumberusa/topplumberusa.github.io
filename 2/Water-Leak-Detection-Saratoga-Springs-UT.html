<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Saratoga Springs UT 84045</h3>
<p>Remember that repiping a house is a major plumbing repair, and you need to just employ a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the task is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, expenses range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Drip legs record wetness so that it doesn't get in the control system. Although small pieces of sediment might make it through a drip leg.</p>
