Insert it back into the drain up until you strike resistance once again, then turn the handle back and forth to work some of the clog complimentary. Pull the auger out periodically to remove particles up until it moves past the clog without resistance.</p>
<p>Colored water-- If your warm water appears rusty, this might be an indication that your water heater is rusting on the inside and may start leaking quickly. You can check on this by filling a number of five-gallon buckets with your water. Compare If your cold water is clear and your hot water is a brownish color, you most likely need a hot water heater replacement.</p>
