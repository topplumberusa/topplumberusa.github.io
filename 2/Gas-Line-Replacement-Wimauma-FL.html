That makes it a terrific factor to employ a professional plumber to install or replace your disposal.

<p>You reside in an older home. There's a great opportunity that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually installed in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are known to corrode and burst when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one if so. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
