<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Pennsburg PA 18073?</h3>
<p>You rely on your drains to carry wastewater from your tub, shower or sink. Over time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products collect in the drain and eventually harden versus the pipe walls, making them hard to remove. Your water heater is leaking: Water heater leakages are one of the most common indications that your system is at the end of its life-span, especially if they are causing major flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are seriously harmed, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes two 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be resistant to root intrusion for up to 100 years.</p>
