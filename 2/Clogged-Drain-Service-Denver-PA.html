<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent guy. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as assured. I will certainly use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The overall you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, however if your toilet is obstructing more than 3 times a month, there's a bigger issue to analyze.
