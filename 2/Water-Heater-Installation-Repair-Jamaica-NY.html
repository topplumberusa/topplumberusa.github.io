<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of small, maybe less important things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
