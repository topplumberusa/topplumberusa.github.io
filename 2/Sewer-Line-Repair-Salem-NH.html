When the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close effectively. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
