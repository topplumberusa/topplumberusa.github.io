<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service. Since they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually regrow after numerous gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
