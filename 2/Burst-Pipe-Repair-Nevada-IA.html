<p>You depend on your drains to carry wastewater from your shower, tub or sink. Over time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products collect in the drain and eventually harden against the pipe walls, making them challenging to get rid of. Your water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leakages are one of the most typical signs that your system is at completion of its life-span, specifically if they are triggering major flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
<p>This might seem like a joke, but it's really serious if you want to genuinely get the most out of your financial investment. Start by asking for a copy of the plumbing inspection checklist.
