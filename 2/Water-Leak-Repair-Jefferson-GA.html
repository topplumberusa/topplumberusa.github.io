<p>Aside from these 2 crucial elements, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less critical things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly.

If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
