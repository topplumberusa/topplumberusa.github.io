<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the pocketbook of a house owner. Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department should fulfill or surpass the state requirements and bring the responsibility for enforcing them.</p>
