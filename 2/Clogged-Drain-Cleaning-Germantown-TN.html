<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Germantown TN</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it also.</p>
