<p>Letters are sent out to residential clients with recognized backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis. Turn the disposal system to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that link it. Depending upon the existing trap setup, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you have a 2-story home, it'll be more pricey to repipe because the plumber will have to browse through walls to do the task. Repiping plumbing lines in your home is a huge task - and it's a task you wish to solve. But the series of plumbing pipe products to choose from can make it confusing. Here we take a look at some of the qualities of the major pipe types to help you pick the right pipe for your plumbing.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
