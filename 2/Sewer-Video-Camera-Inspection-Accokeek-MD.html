<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the wallet of a property owner. Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department need to meet or surpass the state requirements and bring the responsibility for enforcing them.</p>
<p>If you have an older house, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This rust can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have many negative effects on your health. Corroded pipes likewise lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to avoid backflow. The standard ways of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The standard system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
