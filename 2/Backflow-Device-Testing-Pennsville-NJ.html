Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
