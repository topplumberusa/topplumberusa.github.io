<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
