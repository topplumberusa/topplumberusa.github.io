<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
