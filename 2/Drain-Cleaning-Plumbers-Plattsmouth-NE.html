Water pressure may be or fail reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water system (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
