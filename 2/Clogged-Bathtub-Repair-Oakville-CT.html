<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a viable solution, particularly when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they usually consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your home and family.</p>
