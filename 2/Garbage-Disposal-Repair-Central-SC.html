<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made of aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can bring in the irons that would generally trigger rust. After extended usage, these rods will ultimately end up being broken and need to be changed.

<p>We have an inspection program to determine water sources and scenarios that need backflow prevention gadgets. For house, it is important for owners to alert the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial residential or commercial property, the District reviews making use of each new renter. If the present backflow is not up to District code, the correction needs to be made prior to water service is permitted. Cost for the device is covered by either the renter or the property owner.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
