<p>You are accountable for changing the assembly or repairing within 30 days if your assembly stops working the yearly test. All replacements must be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the correct type of assembly based on the conditions on your property (see area below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") In addition, the assembly needs to satisfy the lead free requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 30 days, all water services will be ceased until the assembly is in compliance.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the culprit. However not constantly. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely. A chain with too little slack can trigger problem too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>It usually signifies rust and mineral accumulation if you see low water pressure or blemished water. As rust and minerals build up over time, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you may notice lower water pressure. The discoloration occurs when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your water system, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health threat in your water.</p>

The tank eventually loses its capability to seal properly, creating waste and a greater water expense.</p>
