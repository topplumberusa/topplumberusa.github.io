<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, waste disposal unit do not consist of blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
