<p>Backpressure may take place when the safe and clean supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not effectively protected, potable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system.</p>
<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with house owners in the area. He noted that there are specific pollutants that locals are dealing with and an RO can help reduce those concerns. Due to being largely agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally occurs in some soils and that too can be remedied with the ideal RO system.</p>
