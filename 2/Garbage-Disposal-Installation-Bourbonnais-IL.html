<p>If you have an older house, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This corrosion can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have many unfavorable effects on your health. Corroded pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>With PVC you have a couple of choices if your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering a stoppage. The other is to go ahead and replace the entire line. If the line has to do with 40 years of ages and is showing indications of age throughout, definitely replace. Nowadays, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it may be an acceptable choice to do just that. Nevertheless, if the offset worsens trenchless may no longer be a choice.</p>
