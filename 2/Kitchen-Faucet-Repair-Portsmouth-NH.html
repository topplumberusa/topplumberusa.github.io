Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to utilize salt.

While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself.
