Low water pressure might be due to a multitude of factors, but the most typical factors are sediment accumulation and corrosion, which both obstruct water from going through the whole pipe and put unneeded pressure on particular areas of pipe.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components unusable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain appropriately or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist. Often drain repair needs can be resolved reasonably quickly by a knowledgeable handyman. At other times, however, parts of a drain might need to be taken apart, taken a look at, and cleared before being replaced. In some cases, a handyman might determine that a replacement part is essential (like a tailpiece, pvc, or reducer  trap) to guarantee normal operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman agent today to discuss repair alternatives.</p>
