Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>By itself, gas is colorless and odorless. A lot of energy companies add a sulfur substance to gas, which is where the rotten egg odor originates from.
