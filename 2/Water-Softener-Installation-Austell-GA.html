<p>A lot of softeners have a bypass constructed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to offer some kind of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you select does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to build one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to preserve the unit.</p>

When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
