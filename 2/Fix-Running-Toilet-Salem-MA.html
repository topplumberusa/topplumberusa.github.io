<p>Handheld sprayer. Leaks can in some cases develop on the water lines for handheld sprayers that are connected to the kitchen sink. If the leak is far enough down the water line, water will leak into the cabinet beneath. A reduced pressure backflow preventer is the top of the line when it concerns backflow preventers, and is the device of choice since it can stand up to the introduction of fertilizer or other chemicals, it's likewise a sensible option for residential water supply.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.

When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
