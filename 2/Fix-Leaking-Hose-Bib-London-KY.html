<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>Water system by the water company contains some amounts of hazardous chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems remove these pollutants to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are important requirements, not optional expenses. A home plumbing inspection will either be visual, done with a camera, or a mix of both.</p>
<p>It typically symbolizes rust and mineral buildup if you discover low water pressure or blemished water. As rust and minerals build up in time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you might see lower water pressure. The discoloration takes place when rust becomes loose from the pipes and circulation into your water supply, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or rust can become a health risk in your water.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a major public health danger if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of illness or disease.</p>
