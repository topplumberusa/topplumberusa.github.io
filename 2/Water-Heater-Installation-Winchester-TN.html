The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it gets in the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is attached to completion of the water main. Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have actually discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Because of the intrinsic style of a lowered pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on a very low flow or static flow condition may trigger nuisance dripping and potential fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of fluctuating supply pressure.</p>
