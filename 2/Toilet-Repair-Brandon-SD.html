<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently since hard water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, have to use a growing number of detergent to attain the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Hard minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and decontaminated during regrowth. Finally, water including the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
