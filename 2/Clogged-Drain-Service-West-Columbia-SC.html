<p>The most efficient way to deal with tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>If you have your water tested, the report will use one or both of these units to inform you how difficult your water is. Since the level of calcium carbonate implies little to water customers, water professionals have categorized levels of solidity. Table 1 reveals these categories. Double Check Valve assemblies are the most typical type used on watering systems in Horseshoe Bay.</p>
