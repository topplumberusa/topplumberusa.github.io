For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>

If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted appropriately (Image 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
