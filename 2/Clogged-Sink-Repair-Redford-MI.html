<h3>Know The Work Of The Commercial Plumber Redford MI</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had great evaluations and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it too.</p>

This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as tough water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
