<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
