<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed.

The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

Toilet leakages around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
