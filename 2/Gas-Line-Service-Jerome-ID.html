<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place.

Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
