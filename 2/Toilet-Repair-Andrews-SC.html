<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
