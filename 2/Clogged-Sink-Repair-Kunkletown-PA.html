If your package only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to inappropriate drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
