You can keep smells away by grinding up lemon or orange peels inside it. Harder materials, like eggshells and fish bones, scour the disposal walls and help keep them clean too. It's a good idea to discover a plumber that offers a comprehensive selection of plumbing services. Remember you want a one-stop shop-- that is, one company you can require your different plumbing needs.</p>
