<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and related devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to discover.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a natural gas line might be covered if it is burst. If a contractor is working on an individual's landscaping and inadvertently burst a line, this type of situation may take place.

Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
