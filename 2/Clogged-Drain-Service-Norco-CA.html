<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping.

Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and removes from the capability of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
