<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly focused service of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the salt water tank in the kind of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank lacks salt, the water going through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
