<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a viable option, especially when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they generally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>
