<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, that makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a necessity more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to make sure no valves were mistakenly exposed or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
