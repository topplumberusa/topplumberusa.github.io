<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less crucial things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
