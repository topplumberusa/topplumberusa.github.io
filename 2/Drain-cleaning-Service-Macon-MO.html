<p>Natural gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our houses, for lightening our ranges, and for running home appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally happening gas that happens in the earth's crust and is likewise in some cases formed by the decaying of organic matters like sewage or manure. As useful as this gas is, the features that make this gas unsafe is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer.

A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in very uncommon cases where the building is deemed to not position a risk to the water supply, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
