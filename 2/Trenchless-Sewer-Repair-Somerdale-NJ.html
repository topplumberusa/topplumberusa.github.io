<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Somerdale NJ</h3>
<p>The most effective method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

If so, it is likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another product which has actually rusted and decomposed over the years.
