<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
