<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
