<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly.
