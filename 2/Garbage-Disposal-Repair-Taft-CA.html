<p>Some producers declare that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Lacking warm water unexpectedly is something no homeowner wishes to come across; yet, it's a typical event if your hot water heater isn't performing at complete capability.
