If passes and leaves the softener through your house's pipes and plumbing, note that copper can reenter the water after.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
