<p>Is your house 50+ years of ages? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the main product used in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it usually succumbs to deterioration after about 50 years and requires replacement. Much more modern pipes will not last forever, so watch on plumbing systems that could be reaching the end of their life expectancy.</p>

<p>Since it can spread out infected water back through a distribution system, Backflow is a possible problem in a water system. For instance, backflow at unchecked cross connections (cross-connections are any possible or actual connection in between the general public water system and a source of contamination or pollution) can permit pollutants or contaminants to enter the safe and clean water system. Illness can arise from consuming water that has been contaminated due to backflow.</p>
<p>At Beyer Plumbing, we'll strive to provide you with the professional, high-quality service you need. Our almost 3 decades of industry experience make us the smart option for solving your plumbing problems. Backflow preventers are needed in fire defense systems by the 2018 edition of the Uniform Plumbing Code, the model code established by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO) to promote the general public's health, safety, and welfare by governing the installation and inspection of plumbing systems.</p>

In safe and clean water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a life span of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographical areas with destructive water impurities.</p>
