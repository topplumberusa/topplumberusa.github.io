It is really tough to judge such claims, which are nearly never based on tests that are well sufficient explained to allow others to examine them and to validate the results.

<p>It can take several weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. Initially, plans for each device to be set up need to be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which might use up to 3 weeks or more to process and approve. Turned down strategies should be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval line, which can include another several weeks to the timeline.</p>

Water won't drain or is draining pipes slowly through the disposal.</p>
