<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc developed and built a smaller design that ran on the exact same principle but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also constructed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal.

The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
