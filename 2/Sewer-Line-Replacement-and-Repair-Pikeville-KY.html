Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an appropriately working RPZ assembly to occasionally release small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in locations based on water damage. Appropriate drainage should likewise be supplied.</p>
<p>Water could be dripping onto the pilot light flame. A leaking tank is a reason to call a water heater specialist right away.
