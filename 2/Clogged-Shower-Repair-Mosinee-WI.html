<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains.

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually restore after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a fluctuating water use schedule.</p>
