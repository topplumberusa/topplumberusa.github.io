<p>Keep in mind that repiping a home is a major plumbing repair, and you need to only hire a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to guarantee that the task is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, expenses range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Drip legs record moisture so that it does not get in the control system. Although small pieces of sediment might get through a drip leg.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation in a safe and clean water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just stream in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of least expensive pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The need upstream might trigger a reversal in flow.</p>
