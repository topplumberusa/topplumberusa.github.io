Repiping is a procedure of setting up a brand-new water line plumbing system. This process normally consists of eliminating old easily available pipes and then installing the new plumbing system.

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
