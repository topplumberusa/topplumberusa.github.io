Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Sound-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank.

Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be heated and available for use. Also, corrosion of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a brief life. Request that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see apparent signs of deterioration.</p>
