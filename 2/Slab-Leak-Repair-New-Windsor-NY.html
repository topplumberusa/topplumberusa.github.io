<p>Don't put whatever down your garbage disposal. It's important to view what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly trigger a clog.

In addition, grease and oil can gather and congeal in your drain also. After completing cooking, think about putting leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
