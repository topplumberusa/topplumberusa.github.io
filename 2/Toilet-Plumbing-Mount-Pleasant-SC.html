<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Mount Pleasant SC 29464</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
