<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and associated gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to spot.</p>
