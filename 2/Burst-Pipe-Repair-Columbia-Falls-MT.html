<p>Aside from these 2 important parts, there are a myriad of little, maybe less vital things that can weaken or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
