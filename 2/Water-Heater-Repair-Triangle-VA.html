Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
