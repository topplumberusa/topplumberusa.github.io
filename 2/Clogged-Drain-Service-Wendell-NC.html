<h3>Faucet Repair in Wendell North Carolina</h2>
<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>Roto-Rooter's plumbers are experts in sink repair and are all set to fix your clogged sink or perform a sink installation to fulfill your requirements.

<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
