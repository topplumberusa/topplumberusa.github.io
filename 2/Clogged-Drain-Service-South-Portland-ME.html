<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services South Portland ME</h3>
<p>Sinks should be considered like a machine. They use a range of parts and devices that interact for the functionality of a single sink. For instance, a kitchen sink may include as many as six different systems just to provide the total service we expect. Like any machine, a sink has multiple parts that need repair and maintenance over time.</p>
<p>Domestic water that shows up to your Ohio house brings minerals that can trigger rust on metal parts and components. To prevent corrosion from rust, storage tanks are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod safeguards the tank by attracting damaging materials. By having the anode rod inspected regularly and changed as needed, you can double the life of your water heater.</p>
