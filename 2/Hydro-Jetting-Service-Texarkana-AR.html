<p>Many house owners think their energy companies or homeowners insurance coverage is accountable for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, however the truth is that in many cases you, the property owner, are responsible. Most fundamental homeowners insurance policies and local energy companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the major systems around your house.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not uncommon, however if your toilet is clogging more than 3 times a month, there's a bigger issue to examine. If your toilet is fairly new, you may need to change bathroom tissue or hire a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can look up your state's licensing info. Check the list of state licensing agencies to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also preserves a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
