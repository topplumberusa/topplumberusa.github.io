<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both areas. The backflow preventer you choose need to be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently listed must have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>

Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation.
