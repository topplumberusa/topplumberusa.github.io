<p>In this situation, unclean water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you see your water has an uncommon circulation, odor, taste or color. A plumbing professional can figure out whether the issue with your faucet is a fast fix or the result of other issues in your house's plumbing system. More complicated issues with water temperature or pressure might require changing the water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capacity and type.</p>
