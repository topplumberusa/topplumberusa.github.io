<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing installed during building and construction of a new or refurbished building is set up by knowledgeable craftsmen in accordance with appropriate codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you usually know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is probably in the draining component itself. Obstructions in a component can cause destructive damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>

<p>To figure out if your house is a poly house," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it gets in the home near the water heater. Your main shut down is attached to completion of the water pipe. Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe enters the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
