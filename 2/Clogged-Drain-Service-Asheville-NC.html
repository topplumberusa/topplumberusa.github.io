Lastly, a quality contractor will not danger dealing with a substandard plumber. A basic error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the task with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and suits.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
