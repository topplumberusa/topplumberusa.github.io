<p>A rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, say, you need a new burner set and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

However while small drips should not be cause for concern, house owners ought to keep an eye on the hot water heater leakages. When we required a leak in a pipe repaired, I had a terrific experience with Gotelli Plumbing. Tom was friendly and professional. He also finished the job faster than initial approximated, so the work was less costly than I anticipated. I will use Gotelli Plumbing once again in the future.</p>
