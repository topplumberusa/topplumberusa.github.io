<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by removing firmness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively remove hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
