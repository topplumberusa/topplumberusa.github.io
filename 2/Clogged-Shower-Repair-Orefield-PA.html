<p>While repairing your hot water heater is generally the cheaper option to make, it isn't constantly the best one depending upon your scenario.

<p>In truth, that's how tough water" got its name, from the solidified mineral deposits this type of water leaves behind. With time these deposits can collect, clog, and even corrode pipes and cause major plumbing problems. Tough water deposits can develop in boilers and hot water heaters, making them less effective and more pricey to utilize Toilets have moving parts, and moving parts wear out or break.

<p>There's a good possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away.

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
