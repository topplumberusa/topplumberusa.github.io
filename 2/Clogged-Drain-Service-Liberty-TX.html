<p>While fighting a fire, firefighters are understandably more worried about drawing adequate water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any readily available source to accomplish their goal, but fire department lorries typically bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, deterioration inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer issue identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (usually 10 feet large) where main sewage systems traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can try dumping a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and then turn on the waste disposal unit while running water.

No issue is too great for our extremely trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our experienced plumbing group finishes the job quickly and economically.</p>
