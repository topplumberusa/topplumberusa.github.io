<p>When the potable supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might happen. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not appropriately safeguarded, drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be pushed into the drinkable supply system.</p>
