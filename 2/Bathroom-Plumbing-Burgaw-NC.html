<p>Another common misperception is that calcium-carbonate scale is an effective type of deterioration control. There is an absence of scientific proof supporting this claim, however. Scale does not form in consistent homogeneous layers that would safeguard pipe from rust Scale can be soft or permeable and is highly irregular. Rust can still occur under conditions that are favorable to the formation of hard-water scale or even when hard-water scale is already present.</p>
<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
