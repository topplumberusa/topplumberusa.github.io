<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are needed to carry out website inspections to figure out if a backflow prevention device is required as an outcome of a real or possible  cross-connection hazard on a consumer's plumbing system.

Area Repairs: Using one or a mix of the above services, we will fix the problems we find with the camera inspection directly without rooting out any more than we need to.</p>

Inspect to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be heated up and offered for use.
