Excess Hair: Your shower or bathtub is frequently ground zero for clogs. As hair combines with soap, it can create the perfect storm for plumbing obstructions. Over time, these obstructions can get worse and prevent your bathtub from draining pipes at all.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely hazardous if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the appropriate safety measures.</p>
