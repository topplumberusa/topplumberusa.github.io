<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Glen Oaks NY 11004</h3>
<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to obstructions that originate inside the home. It is possible for drains to become clogged due to tree roots, likewise referred to as tree root intrusion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The kind of drain pipes already installed, such as cast iron, clay, plastic or copper, will determine the degree of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are badly harmed, for changing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes two four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new smooth pipe behind it.
