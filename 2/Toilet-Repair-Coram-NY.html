<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with property owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are specific impurities that residents are handling and an RO can help relieve those concerns. Due to being mainly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils which too can be treated with the best RO system.</p>
