Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
