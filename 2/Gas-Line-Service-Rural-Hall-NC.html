If you are having a toilet that obstructs continuously and in need of toilet repair from Vegas Valley Plumbing on a regular basis, then it's probably time for a brand-new toilet. This might be an indication that your toilet has a defective part or there is a different obstruction in your sewer lines. In either case, you need to call us for a home plumbing inspection immediately.</p>
