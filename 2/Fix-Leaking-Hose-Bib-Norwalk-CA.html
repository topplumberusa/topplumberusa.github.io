If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the part, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
