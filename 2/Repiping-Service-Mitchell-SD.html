<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable amount, there must be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through.

Another pointer to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils.
