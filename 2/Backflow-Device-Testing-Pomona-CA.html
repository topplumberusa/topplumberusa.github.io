<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Pomona CA</h3>
<p>If pressure is lost, a backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from flowing back to the City system. Backflow can contaminate the water system.

<p>The most typical approach for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, normally sodium. Salt won't cause lime scale or soap scum buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds just a really small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is thought about really low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
