<p>E.R. Services understands the significance of preserving the integrity and effectiveness of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you discover unusual popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your system, this could be a sign that sediment has built up in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating component.

To fix this issue, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
