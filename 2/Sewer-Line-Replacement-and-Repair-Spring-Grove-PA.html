<p>Aside from these two essential elements, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less crucial things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>

<p>It helps to understand the brand name and model of your toilet. The brand is usually on the bowl behind the seat.

Even professional plumbers sometimes attempt two or three flappers before they discover one that works well.</p>
