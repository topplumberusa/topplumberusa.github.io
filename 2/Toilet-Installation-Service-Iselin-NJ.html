<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize an option of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We advise organic items, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than products including extreme chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>Hydro-jetting is a technique of getting rid of build up and debris in tanks and lines by using incredibly high-pressure water to get rid of blockages. These blockages could have been made from grease, heavy sludge, or tree roots that have built up in time. Hydro jetting's advanced technology enables the process to be efficient and quick.
