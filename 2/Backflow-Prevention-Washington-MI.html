<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Washington MI</h3>

<p>Due to the fact that of the fundamental design of a lowered pressure backflow assembly, varying supply pressure on an exceptionally low circulation or fixed flow condition might trigger nuisance dripping and possible fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of changing supply pressure.</p>
