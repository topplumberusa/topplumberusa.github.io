<p>On and off does any structural damage occur as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is typically discovered before it causes any substantial damage. The water leak is generally the size of a pinhole. This little hole permits water to continually leak out extremely gradually. Over time it can result in a significant construct of water.

<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200).
