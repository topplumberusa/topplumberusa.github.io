<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really hazardous if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the suitable precautions if using among these products.</p>
