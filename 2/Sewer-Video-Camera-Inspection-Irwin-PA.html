<p>A lot of common single family home systems will not need supply piping bigger than 3⁄4 inch (19 mm) due to expenditure along with steel piping's propensity to become obstructed from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the inside of the pipe over time once the internal galvanizing zinc coating has broken down. In safe and clean water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not unusual for it to be less in geographical areas with destructive water impurities.</p>
