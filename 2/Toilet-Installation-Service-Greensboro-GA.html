If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
