<p>When utilized in fighting a fire, fire department connections can be an issue. Firefighters by and large are not concerned with backflow prevention issues. They are worrying about protecting people's lives and to a lower extent their property. Getting the needed volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will utilize water from any source available to achieve that objective. This can develop cross-connection control problems and may as a result mean that the level of security on the fire security system might need to be increased to a high hazard protection level.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
