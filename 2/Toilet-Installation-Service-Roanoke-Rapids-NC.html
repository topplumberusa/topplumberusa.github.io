<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. If the water shuts off, you may have the ability to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. Make sure it's adjusted correctly (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the measure of hydrogen ion activity in a service and is utilized to express the intensity of the level of acidity of a service. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up deterioration Carbon dioxide will possibly add to the development of carbonic acid, consequently making the water more corrosive. The existence of high levels of co2 tends to associate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
