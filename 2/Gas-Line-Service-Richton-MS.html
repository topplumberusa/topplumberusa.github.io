<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently listen and lift the rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's adjusted properly (Photo 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above methods do not work, the next step would be to get rid of the P-trap under the sink. Place a bucket beneath the area to catch water then loosen the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place. Nowadays, many kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
