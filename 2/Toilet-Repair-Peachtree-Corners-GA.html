<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to determine on each component is the guide.

In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
