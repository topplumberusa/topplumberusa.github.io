<p>Aside from these two essential parts, there are a myriad of little, maybe less important things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
