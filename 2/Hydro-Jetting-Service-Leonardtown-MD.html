<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending on the product. To preserve your security, health, and home comfort, we utilize just the best piping: polyethylene.

<p>The list of things a food disposer can consume is relatively short. Soft or crisp foods are great, however hard or stringy foods can be difficulty. Disposers can be dropped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, in addition to the typical kitchen flotsam, consisting of pop-tabs, scouring pads and twist-ties. While some older homes may not have backflow preventers, all more recent properties are required to have them. Doug's can help you find and determine them if you're not sure what kind of backflow preventers are utilized in your house or business. We can also perform your yearly backflow inspections.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets should absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet must be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural stability of the house.</p>
