<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the solution with firmness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is free of firmness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>The most common approach for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, typically salt. Salt won't cause lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds only a very small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is thought about extremely low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
