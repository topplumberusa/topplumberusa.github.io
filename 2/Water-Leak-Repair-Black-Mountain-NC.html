<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Black Mountain NC 28711?</h3>
<p>Strange Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is coming from your drain, it probably requires a thorough cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to pass through. Since of the tight space, the pipes often make strange gurgling sounds as water attempts to go through a clogged pipe. This triggers the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are available, resulting in the odd sounds emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the perpetrator. But not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with insufficient slack can cause difficulty too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
