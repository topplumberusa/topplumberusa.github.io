<p>Depending upon what part of the world you're from you might have heard sink disposals described as waste disposal unit," food waste disposers," or, if you're actually appropriate, a sink waste disposal unit." Whatever you call it, switching one out or installing a brand-new one is a fairly basic task. The work on private mains generally takes one to two weeks, and service work typically takes an extra one to two weeks, though some might be carried out simultaneously on a job.
