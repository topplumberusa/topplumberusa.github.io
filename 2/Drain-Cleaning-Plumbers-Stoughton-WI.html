It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
