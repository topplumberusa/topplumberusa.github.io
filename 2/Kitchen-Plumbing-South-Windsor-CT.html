<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over an amount of time the within lining of the pipe will weaken and a small pinhole leak will establish. In some cases the solution is to repair the damaged section of pipe, and an area repair is all that is required to resolve the concern. Other times a more extensive service is required: repiping.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers improves water's taste, but its steep price tag makes it impractical as a household option.
