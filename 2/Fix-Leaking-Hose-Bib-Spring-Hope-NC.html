<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
