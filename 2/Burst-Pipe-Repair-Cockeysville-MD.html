<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to find.</p>
