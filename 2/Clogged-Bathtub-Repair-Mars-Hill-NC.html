<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Mars Hill NC 28754</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of circulation in a safe and clean water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can just stream in one instructions. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to assist battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The need upstream could cause a reversal in flow.</p>
