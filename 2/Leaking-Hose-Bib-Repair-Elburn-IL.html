<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. CenterPoint Energy's Home Service Plus offers you an optional Pipe Defense Prepare for just $3.95 a month. It covers interior, easily accessible, natural gas pipes ranging from the gas meter to your natural gas devices. Auto-reverse setting: Some waste disposal unit come with this setting, which reverses the direction the blades spin to clear waste. This secures the blades so they do not wear as fast.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this accreditation. I've talked to a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the rate to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
