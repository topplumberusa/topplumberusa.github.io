<p>The U-shaped pipe below bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that individuals expect to see but seldom stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it does not grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>

Another pointer to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
