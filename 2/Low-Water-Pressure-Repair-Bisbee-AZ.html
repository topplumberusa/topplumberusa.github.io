<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can trigger deterioration that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and takes away from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
