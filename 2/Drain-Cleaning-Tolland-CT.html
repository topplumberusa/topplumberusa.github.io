<h3>Drain Cleaning Techniques in Tolland CT 06084</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
