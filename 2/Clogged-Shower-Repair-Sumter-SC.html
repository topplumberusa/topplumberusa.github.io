<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Sumter SC</h3>
<p>To determine if your house is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it enters the house near the water heater. Your main turned off is attached to the end of the water pipe. Make sure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have actually found cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, known as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home. Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them working correctly. Leaking pipes can impact your indoor air quality. If a repipe in Brenham is ideal for you, call today at (979) 200-6674 to have your plumbing examined and we will let you know.</p>
