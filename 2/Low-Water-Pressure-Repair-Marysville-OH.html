<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Marysville OH</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
