Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regrowth).

<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can happen with time from the buildup of hair, bits of soap and fibers from towels that builds up within pipes. As a clog becomes bigger in time, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining appropriately.

<p>One of the things we concentrate on is the bathroom toilet. Many people and organisations let the toilet waste water every year with leaking or ineffective models. This is money and a natural deposit running down the drain. Water conservation in the desert is important and older toilets can use 3.5 gallons of water per flush!
