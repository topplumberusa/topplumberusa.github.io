<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly.

The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high risk security assembly.</p>
