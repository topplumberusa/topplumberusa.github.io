<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
