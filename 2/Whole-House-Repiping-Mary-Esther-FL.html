<p>Changing your sink is a detailed process. Procedure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
