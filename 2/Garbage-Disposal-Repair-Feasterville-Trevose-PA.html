The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>

You can't constantly be particular whether the house has had drainage problems, and if so, whether the previous homeowner understood the factor for the clog An easy camera inspection could make you aware of a extremely pricey and concealed issue prior to the purchase.</p>
