<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>The salary range noted here is based on national averages and consists of all experience levels, from first-year apprentices through to extremely experienced journeypersons. Incomes can differ depending upon the agreement, company, area and collective contracts (if relevant), as well as local and national economic conditions. Overtime is not included.</p>
