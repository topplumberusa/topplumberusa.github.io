<p>I can't say enough good things about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had a really brief amount of time due to closing on a home sale. Every person I came across from Marquita doing logistics for my job to every member of the work crew. Friendly, communicated well, completely responsive and really cared to assist me through this extremely difficult job. All of the people I came across were role models for what a well run service company ought to be. Much thanks and gratitude. You're great.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>That is an indicator the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. Schedule a price quote as soon as possible and guarantee nothing is near the heater that might be possibly harmed if it is in a garage and a small slow leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst triggering water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
