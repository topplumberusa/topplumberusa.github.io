It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it as well.</p>
