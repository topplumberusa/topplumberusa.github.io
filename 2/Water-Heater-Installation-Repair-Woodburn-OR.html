<p>In this scenario, dirty water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank.

The difficult water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
