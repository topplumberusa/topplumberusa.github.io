<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
