<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required.

The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
