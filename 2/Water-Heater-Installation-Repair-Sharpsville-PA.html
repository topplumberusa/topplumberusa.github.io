<p>If the toilet can not be fixed, or if the repair cost techniques replacement cost, we'll discuss your options. Chemical drain cleaners are a popular approach of clearing clogs.

Like any home appliance, a toilet tank includes numerous little moving parts that may need replaced with use with time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and trigger toilet leakages that aren't clearly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
