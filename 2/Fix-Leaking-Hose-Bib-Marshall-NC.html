<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Marshall NC</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
