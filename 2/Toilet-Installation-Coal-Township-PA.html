Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
