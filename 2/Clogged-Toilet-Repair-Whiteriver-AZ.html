<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of little, maybe less crucial things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
