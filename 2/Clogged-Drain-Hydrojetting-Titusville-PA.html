You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
