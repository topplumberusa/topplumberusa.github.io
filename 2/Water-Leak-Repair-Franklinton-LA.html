Local plumber estimated cost of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ happy I inspected around. Under the sink, place a container or pan underneath the drain, then utilize locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to disconnect the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen up the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
<p>Think of all the areas water flows in and out of your home. These are the locations that a professional assessment must cover.
