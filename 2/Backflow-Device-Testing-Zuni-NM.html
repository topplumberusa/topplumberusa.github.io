The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
