<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will develop. Often the service is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is essential to resolve the concern. Other times a more extensive service is required: repiping.</p>
<p>Add more warm water if it gradually recedes as you work. Keep plunging up until the drain is clear or you decide it's time to attempt a brand-new approach. Tankless systems link directly to your plumbing and just heat the water as it is required. This results in cost savings on your energy costs. Double Check Valve Assembly (DC): A DC is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes 2 individually acting, spring-loaded check valves.</p>
