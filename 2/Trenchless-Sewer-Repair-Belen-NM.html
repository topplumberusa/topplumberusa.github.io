<p>A lot of typical single family house systems will not need supply piping bigger than 3‚ÅÑ4 inch (19 mm) due to expense along with steel piping's tendency to become blocked from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the inside of the pipe with time once the internal galvanizing zinc finishing has actually degraded. In safe and clean water circulation service, galvanized steel pipe has a life span of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not unusual for it to be less in geographic areas with corrosive water contaminants.</p>
