<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing procedure includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive product. Storage tank water heaters are the most common, and are run with gas. Their style includes an insulated tank where water is heated and stored until required. Gas hot water heater are more energy effective and operating costs are reduced by about 50 percent, compared to electric water heaters.

I have actually consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would expect the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
