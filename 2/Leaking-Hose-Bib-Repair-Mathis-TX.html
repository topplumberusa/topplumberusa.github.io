Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
