<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to guarantee that all plumbing set up during building of a new or remodelled structure is installed by experienced artisans in accordance with appropriate codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you usually know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. However, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining component itself. Blockages in a fixture can cause detrimental damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>
<p>If the pipes that need to be fixed run listed below landscaping or below your home or building. Hydro jetting uses innovative technology to send out a strong stream of water through your pipes to search the interiors and eliminate persistent clogs. In some cases we use an unique camera prior to hydro jetting to target the specific problems inside your pipes.</p>

<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
