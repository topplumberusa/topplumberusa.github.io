<p>The trick to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there need to be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through.

Another tip to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted appropriately (Image 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
