<p>Most softeners have a bypass developed into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to offer some sort of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's wise to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to maintain the system.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
