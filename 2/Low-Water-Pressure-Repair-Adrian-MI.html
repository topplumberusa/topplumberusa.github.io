Rather, our professionals use a bursting tool that forces the existing pipeline to burst" and break apart. A new pipeline is instantly pulled in and fills in the void created by the old, burst pipe in a residential or commercial  sewer. This repair method is typically used to replace the old pipe with a similar or larger pipe.</p>
<p>Related work experience or conclusion of a plumber program at a college or technical institute can reduce the time needed to complete your apprenticeship.

Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main drains traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
