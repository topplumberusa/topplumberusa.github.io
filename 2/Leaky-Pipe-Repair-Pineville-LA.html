<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not successfully remove solidity from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
