<p>The electrical hot water heater is among the most popular models chosen by customers.

<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our houses, for lightening our stoves, and for running home appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially called marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that takes place in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the decomposing of raw materials like sewage or manure. As useful as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. Nevertheless, to thwart off that danger, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which gives it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking. Make sure to just rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
