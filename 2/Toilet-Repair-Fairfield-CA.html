<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
