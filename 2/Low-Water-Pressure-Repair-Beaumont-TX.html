It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an appropriately working RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water.

Appropriate drainage must also be supplied.</p>

<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
