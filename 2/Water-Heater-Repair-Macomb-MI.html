<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Macomb MI</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
