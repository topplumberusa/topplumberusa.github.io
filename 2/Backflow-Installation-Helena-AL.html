The city or Uruk contains the oldest recognized examples of brick built Latrines, built atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had changeable and quickly removable sections, and enabled cleaning.</p>

<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
