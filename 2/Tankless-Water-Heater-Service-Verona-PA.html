<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. Since they restore whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally regenerate after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. Such models are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
