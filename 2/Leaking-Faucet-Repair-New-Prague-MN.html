<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
