<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
