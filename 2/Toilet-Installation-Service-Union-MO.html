For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed.

We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
