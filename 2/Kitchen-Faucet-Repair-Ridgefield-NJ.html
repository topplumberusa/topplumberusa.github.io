Water conditioners do not successfully get rid of solidity from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
<p>It's an oddly complicated scientific process, however easy to treat. It uses salt to get rid of smells and minerals discovered in hard water- most commonly calcium and magnesium.

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
