<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of maintaining the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you discover unusual popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this could be an indicator that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating component. Lacking warm water quickly is another indication of sediment build-up, since the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
