Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
