Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to discover.</p>
