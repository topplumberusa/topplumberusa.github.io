If, say, you need a brand-new burner set and the hot water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>

The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard security assembly.</p>
