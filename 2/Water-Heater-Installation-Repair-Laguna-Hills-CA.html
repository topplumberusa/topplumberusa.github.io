<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
