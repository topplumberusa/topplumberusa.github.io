<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains.

You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
